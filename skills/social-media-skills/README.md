## What are Skills?

Skills are markdown files that give AI agents specialised knowledge and workflows for specific tasks. When you install these in your project, Claude recognises when you're working on a social media task and applies the right patterns, voice rules, and platform constraints.

## How Skills Work Together

Every skill reads shared context. The `voice-builder` skill is the foundation. Every other skill checks it first (via `about-me.md` and `voice.md`) before drafting a line.

"Make me a carousel from this" → gemini-carousel
"What should I post this week" → niche-research or content-matrix
"Turn this outlier Reel into a script" → reels-scripting
