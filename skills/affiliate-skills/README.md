### Without affiliate-skills

- You Google "best affiliate programs" and get SEO spam written to rank, not to help
- You write content from gut feeling with no idea what format actually performs
- You have no data on what's trending, what hooks work, or what gaps exist
- You spend 4 hours on a landing page that converts at 0.2%
- You pick programs by vibes instead of data

## How It Works — The Affiliate Flywheel

```
  S1 RESEARCH ──▶ S2 CONTENT ──▶ S3 BLOG & SEO ──▶ S4 OFFERS & LANDING
       ▲                                                    │
       │                                                    ▼
       │                                              S5 DISTRIBUTION
       │                                                    │
       └──────────── S6 ANALYTICS ◀─────────────────────────┘
                          │
                          ▼
                    S7 AUTOMATION → SCALE
                          │
                    S8 META (across all)
```

**Closed loop.** S6 Analytics feeds BACK to S1 Research. Every skill knows what comes next (`chain_metadata.suggested_next`) and what feeds it. Data flows forward through the funnel and back through analytics.

**Data-driven.** S1 skills don't just find programs — they scout what content is actually performing (views, likes, shares), analyze traffic, and rank angles by real engagement data. By the time you write, you already know what format, hook, and platform to use.

**Research-backed.** Content skills don't write from thin air. `content-research-brief` collects real source articles first. Your posts have real stats, real quotes, and current information.

## Demo: zero to first commission

```
You:  I want to promote AI video tools. What's trending?

AI:   [runs trending-content-scout]

      Scanned 47 videos across YouTube + TikTok.

      Top format: comparison (45% of top content, avg engagement: 35.2)
      Best hook: "I replaced my $5K video team with AI" (engagement: 42.3)
      Gap: nobody comparing HeyGen vs Synthesia on TikTok
      Benchmark: median 18K views, top 10% needs 85K+

You:  What's the best program to promote?

AI:   [runs affiliate-program-search + traffic-analyzer]

       Name         Commission        Cookie    Stars   Traffic Score
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       HeyGen       30% recurring     60 days   ★ 127   82/100
       Synthesia    25% one-time      30 days   ★ 84    76/100
       D-ID         20% recurring     45 days   ★ 52    61/100

      HeyGen wins: highest commission, recurring, longest cookie,
      strongest website traffic (2.1M monthly visits, 35% direct).

You:  Research the latest about HeyGen for a LinkedIn post.

AI:   [runs content-research-brief]

      📚 7 sources collected (5 fully fetched)
      🏷️ Tags: AI (7), Funding (2), Tools (5)

      Key stats:
      - "$60M Series A at $500M valuation" — TechCrunch
      - "40,000+ businesses use HeyGen" — company blog
      - "Avatar 3.0 launched with real-time lip sync" — The Verge

      3 angles generated:
      1. "HeyGen just raised $60M — here's what it means for AI video"
      2. "I tested HeyGen vs Synthesia for 30 days — honest comparison"
      3. "AI video tools are killing the $45B production industry"

You:  Write angle 2 as a LinkedIn post with an infographic.

AI:   [runs viral-post-writer + infographic-generator]

      Post: 1,200-char comparison post, bold claim hook,
      soft CTA in comments, FTC disclosure.

      Infographic: side-by-side comparison card (1080×1350),
      HeyGen vs Synthesia — commission, features, pricing.
      Dark modern palette, self-contained HTML ready to render.

You:  Now a TikTok script.

AI:   [runs tiktok-script-writer]

      45-second script, demo_first hook (backed by scout data):
      "Watch me create a $2,000 video for free in 30 seconds."
      Hook → Pain → Demo → Result → CTA. Bio link reminder.

You:  Plan my full funnel — I have 5 hours/week.

AI:   [runs funnel-planner]

      Week 1: Scout + Research → find winning angles + collect sources
      Week 2: Content → 5 LinkedIn posts + 2 TikToks + 2 infographics
      Week 3: Blog → comparison article backed by research brief
      Week 4: Deploy → landing page + bio link live
      Week 5: Analytics → compare your metrics vs scout benchmark
      Week 6: Optimize → double down on what beat the benchmark

      Target: first affiliate click by week 2, first commission by week 5.
```

## Who this is for

**Affiliates** — Find programs, create content, track performance. Data-driven, not vibes.

**Influencers & Creators** — Research what's trending, create platform-native content, add infographics. Know what format and hook to use before you create.

**Marketers** — Content research, competitive analysis, multi-platform strategy. Research briefs replace guesswork with real sources and stats.

**Affiliate Networks** — Evaluate program quality, benchmark advertiser traffic, understand affiliate landscape. `traffic-analyzer` + `affiliate-program-search` as audit tools.

**Advertisers** — Audit your own program positioning. See how affiliates talk about your product. Understand what content drives the most engagement for your brand.

**AI-native teams** — Plug skills into any agent pipeline. Every skill has typed input/output schemas, `chain_metadata`, and `suggested_next` for autonomous chaining.

This is not a prompt pack. It is an operating system for affiliates who ship.

## Companion Tools

affiliate-skills are pure Markdown — they work with any AI. For enhanced capabilities, pair with these tools:

### [hidrix-tools](https://github.com/sonpiaz/hidrix-tools) — MCP Server + Pi Extension

16-tool MCP server for live social data, scraping, and content analysis. When connected, skills like `trending-content-scout` get exact engagement metrics. Works with Claude Code (MCP), Pi (native extension), OpenClaw, Hermes, Cursor.

| Category | Tools | What they add |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| **Search** | `web_search`, `x_search`, `reddit_search`, `reddit_subreddit_top`, `youtube_search`, `tiktok_search` | Cross-platform search with engagement data |
| **Scrape** | `web_fetch`, `x_thread_reader`, `x_user_posts`, `reddit_thread_reader`, `facebook_scraper` | Full content extraction — threads, pages, groups, ads |
| **Analyze** | `content_scorer`, `content_analyzer` | Engagement scoring, topic clusters, pattern detection |
| **Intel** | `similarweb_traffic` | Website traffic analytics |

**Key upgrades (v2.0):**
- `x_search` now returns likes, retweets, views + advanced operators (`from:user`, `min_faves:100`)
- `x_thread_reader` reads full X threads and long-form articles
- `facebook_scraper` scrapes groups, pages, keyword search, AND Meta Ad Library (free)
- `content_scorer` + `content_analyzer` = full content pipeline
- `reddit_thread_reader` + `reddit_subreddit_top` use free Reddit API (no key needed)
- 4 free tools (no API key): `reddit_thread_reader`, `reddit_subreddit_top`, `content_scorer`, `content_analyzer`

**Tool chains for affiliate skills:**
- `trending-content-scout` → `x_search` + `reddit_subreddit_top` + `youtube_search` → `content_scorer`
- `competitor-spy` → `facebook_scraper(ads)` + `x_user_posts` → `content_analyzer`
- `content-research-brief` → `web_search` → `web_fetch` (multiple URLs) → `content_analyzer`
- `traffic-analyzer` → `similarweb_traffic`

```bash
# Install (MCP — for Claude Code, Cursor, OpenClaw, Hermes)
git clone https://github.com/sonpiaz/hidrix-tools.git ~/.hidrix-tools
cd ~/.hidrix-tools && bun install && cp .env.example .env
# Add your API keys to .env

# Install (Pi — native extension, no MCP)
cp -r ~/.hidrix-tools/integrations/pi-extension ~/.pi/agent/extensions/hidrix-tools
```

### [content-pipeline](https://github.com/Affitor/content-pipeline) — LinkedIn Content App

Web app for the full content creation workflow: research → write → infographic. Uses Brave Search + Claude + Satori rendering. The skills `content-research-brief` and `infographic-generator` were inspired by this pipeline.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Affitor/content-pipeline.git
cd content-pipeline && npm install && cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

---

## How it works

Each skill is a single Markdown file (`SKILL.md`) that tells any AI exactly how to execute a specific affiliate marketing task. Skills define:

- **When to trigger** — natural language patterns that activate the skill
- **Input/Output schemas** — structured data for agent interop
- **Workflow** — step-by-step procedure with decision points
- **Chaining** — how outputs from one skill feed into the next
- **API integration** — optional API configs for enhanced data (see [`social-data-providers.md`](shared/references/social-data-providers.md))

Skills pass data through conversation context, not files. Run S1 to scout trending content, then S2 uses that engagement data automatically — no copy-pasting.

## Entry points

You don't have to start from S1. Jump in wherever you are:

- **New to affiliate marketing:** S8 `funnel-planner` → it plans everything for you
- **Want to see what's trending:** S1 `trending-content-scout` → scan platforms for top content
- **Have a product already:** S2 (write content) or S3 (write a review)
- **Need research first:** S2 `content-research-brief` → collect sources before writing
- **Have content, need pages:** S4 (landing page) or S5 (bio link)
- **Want to optimize:** S6 (analytics + SEO audit)
- **Ready to scale:** S7 (automation + paid ads)
- **Not sure which skill:** S8 `skill-finder`

## For Developers

Building an agent pipeline? Here's what you need:

- **[`registry.json`](registry.json)** — machine-readable index of all 52 skills with metadata
- **[`API.md`](API.md)** — full REST API documentation for list.affitor.com
- **[`prompts/bootstrap.md`](prompts/bootstrap.md)** — system prompt that bootstraps the full agent
- **[`social-data-providers.md`](shared/references/social-data-providers.md)** — configure API providers for social data
- **`agents/openai.yaml`** — OpenAI-compatible tool definitions (in skills that have them)
- **Input/Output schemas** — every SKILL.md has typed schemas for structured data exchange
