> **Path within category:** `SKILL.md`


# affiliate-check: Live Affiliate Program Data

Query affiliate program data from list.affitor.com in real-time. Persistent daemon
with in-memory cache — first call auto-starts the server, every subsequent call is instant.

## SETUP (run this check BEFORE any affiliate-check command)

Before using any command, find the skill and check if the binary exists:

```bash
# Check project-level first, then user-level
if test -x .claude/skills/affiliate-skills/tools/dist/affiliate-check; then
  A=.claude/skills/affiliate-skills/tools/dist/affiliate-check
elif test -x ~/.claude/skills/affiliate-skills/tools/dist/affiliate-check; then
  A=~/.claude/skills/affiliate-skills/tools/dist/affiliate-check
else
  echo "NEEDS_SETUP"
fi
```

Set `A` to whichever path exists and use it for all commands.

If `NEEDS_SETUP`:
1. Tell the user: "affiliate-check needs a one-time build (~10 seconds). OK to proceed?"
2. If approved, run: `cd <SKILL_DIR> && ./setup`
3. If `bun` is not installed: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`

## 3. Expert Skill: competitor-spy
> **Path within category:** `skills/research/competitor-spy/SKILL.md`


# Competitor Spy

Analyze competitor affiliate sites, YouTube channels, and social profiles to
surface which programs they promote, what content drives their traffic, and
which strategies are worth replicating. Outputs an actionable reverse-engineering
report so you can skip years of trial and error.

## Stage

This skill belongs to Stage S1: Research

## When to Use

- User wants to know what programs are working in a specific niche
- User has a competitor site/channel in mind and wants to understand their strategy
- User is entering a new niche and wants a shortcut to what works
- User wants to find underserved content gaps a competitor hasn't covered
- User asks "how do top affiliates in [niche] make money?"

## Input Schema

```
{
  competitor_url: string      # (optional) Direct URL to competitor site, channel, or profile
  niche: string               # (optional) Niche to analyze if no specific competitor given
  platform: string            # (optional) "blog" | "youtube" | "tiktok" | "twitter" | "newsletter"
  depth: string               # (optional, default: "standard") "quick" | "standard" | "deep"
  focus: string               # (optional) "programs" | "content" | "traffic" | "all"
}
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Competitors to Analyze

If `competitor_url` is provided, skip to Step 2.

If only `niche` is provided, find 3-5 top competitors:
1. `web_search "best [niche] affiliate sites"` — look for review/comparison sites
2. `web_search "[niche] review site affiliate"` — find review-first monetization models
3. `web_search "[niche] blog affiliate income report"` — income reports reveal programs
4. Note: YouTube — `web_search "youtube [niche] affiliate site:youtube.com"` to find channels

Pick 3 competitors that are clearly affiliate-driven (review pages, comparison tables,
"best X" content, Amazon links, affiliate disclaimers visible).

### Step 2: Identify Affiliate Programs They Promote

For each competitor site/channel:

**Method A — Link analysis:**
- `web_fetch [competitor_url]` and scan for outbound links
- Look for: `?ref=`, `?via=`, `/go/`, `aff_id=`, `?affiliate=`, `shareasale.com`,
  `impact.com`, `partnerstack.com`, `awin.com`, `cj.com`, `linktr.ee`
- These patterns indicate affiliate links

**Method B — Content analysis:**
- Look at their top content: "Best X", "X vs Y", "X Review", "X Alternatives"
- Every product featured prominently = likely affiliate relationship
- Products mentioned with a CTA button ("Try X Free", "Get X") = strong affiliate signal

**Method C — Disclosure scan:**
- Search page for "affiliate", "commission", "sponsored", "partner" disclosures
- These legally required disclosures often appear at top/bottom and reveal programs

**Method D — Income reports (if available):**
- `web_search "[site name] income report affiliate"` — some affiliates publish earnings
- `web_search "[creator name] how I make money affiliate"` — creator transparency posts

Extract for each program found: name, estimated prominence (primary/secondary/mentioned),
content type promoting it, and whether it appears on list.affitor.com.

### Step 2.5: Analyze Competitor Content Engagement (data-driven)

For each competitor, scan their recent content performance across social platforms.
This reveals not just WHAT they create, but HOW WELL it performs.

**With API (optional — see `shared/references/social-data-providers.md`):**
- Search YouTube/TikTok for competitor brand name or channel
- Get views, likes, comments, shares for their top 10-20 content pieces
- Calculate engagement_score for each: `(likes × 2 + comments × 3 + shares × 5) / max(views, 1) × 1000`
- Identify which content format gets them the highest engagement
- Compare their engagement against `trending-content-scout` benchmark (if available)

**Without API (default):**
- `web_search "[competitor name] youtube channel"` → find their channel
- `web_fetch` channel page → extract view counts from visible videos
- `web_search "[competitor name] tiktok"` → find top videos with view counts
- `web_search "[competitor name] best video"` → find their highest-performing content
- Note: approximate data, but reveals relative performance patterns

**Extract for each competitor:**
- **Avg engagement score** — how well does their content perform overall?
- **Strongest platform** — where do they get the most traction?
- **Weakest platform** — which platforms are they ignoring? (gap to exploit)
- **Top performing content** — their 3-5 best pieces by engagement
- **Format that works for them** — which content format gets them the most engagement?

Add these to the competitor assessment table in Step 5:

| Dimension | Score (1-10) | Assessment |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Content Engagement | — | How well does their content perform? High = proven demand, low = weak execution |
| Platform Strength | — | Which platform are they strongest on? Which are they ignoring? |

### Step 3: Analyze Their Content Strategy

For each competitor, extract:

**Content patterns:**
- Most common formats: listicles ("10 best X"), comparisons ("X vs Y"), tutorials,
  reviews, roundups, case studies
- Average content depth: shallow (<1000 words), standard (1000-3000), deep (3000+)
- Publishing frequency: estimate from visible dates or `web_search "site:[domain] 2024"`
- Content freshness: are articles updated? When?

**Traffic indicators (from web search signals):**
- `web_search "site:[domain]"` — rough page count
- Search for their brand name — how much branded traffic/discussion?
- Look for "X review" queries in their content — review content = high buyer intent

**SEO and social signals:**
- Do they rank for "[product] review" terms? (indicates SEO strategy)
- Active social profiles linked from site? Which platforms?
- Do they have a newsletter/email list? (footer signup forms)

### Step 4: Find Content Gaps

Compare competitor content to what's NOT covered:
1. Products they promote but haven't done deep comparison posts for
2. Common user questions (from YouTube comments, Reddit threads, forums) they haven't answered
3. New product launches in the niche that competitors haven't covered yet
4. Angles competitors avoid (negative reviews, honest cons, "X is not for everyone")

Use `web_search "reddit [niche] [product] problems"` to find pain points no affiliate
has addressed honestly — these make high-converting, low-competition content.

### Step 5: Score Competitor Strategies

For each competitor, assess:

| Dimension | Score (1-10) | Assessment |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Program Quality | — | Are they promoting high-commission recurring programs or low-margin one-off? |
| Content Quality | — | Shallow listicles vs. deep genuine reviews |
| SEO Sophistication | — | Thin content vs. well-structured, keyword-targeted |
| Monetization Diversity | — | One program vs. multiple revenue streams |
| Replicability | — | How hard is it to do what they do, but better? |

Higher replicability score = easier to beat them.

### Step 6: Build the Intelligence Report

Synthesize findings into a 3-part report:
1. **Programs worth stealing** — top programs their strategy validates
2. **Content formats that clearly work** — patterns worth replicating
3. **Gaps to exploit** — angles they've missed that you can own

### Step 7: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] Confidence levels match evidence strength (confirmed = affiliate link found, likely = brand mention pattern, possible = inferred)
- [ ] Programs cross-checked on list.affitor.com where possible
- [ ] Replicability score accounts for barriers (domain authority, team size)
- [ ] No hallucinated competitor data — all claims traceable to web_search results

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```

## Output Format

```
## Competitor Intelligence Report: [Niche]

### Competitors Analyzed

| Competitor | Programs Found | Content Focus | Replicability |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| [site1.com] | [Program A, B, C] | Best-of lists, comparisons | 7/10 |
| [site2.com] | [Program D, E] | YouTube reviews | 8/10 |


### Content Formats That Work in This Niche

1. **[Format 1]:** [What it is, why it works, example from competitor]
2. **[Format 2]:** [...]
3. **[Format 3]:** [...]


## Next Steps

1. Run `affiliate-program-search` to evaluate the top validated programs
2. Run `commission-calculator` to compare earnings potential across programs
3. Start with the highest-gap content angle: [Gap 1] for [Program A]
```

## Error Handling

- **Competitor URL blocked or paywalled:** Fall back to web_search signals (Google cache,
  SimilarWeb mentions, blog posts about the competitor). Note limitations in report.
- **No obvious affiliate links found:** Competitor may use native ads or direct sponsorships
  instead. Flag this and look for brand mention patterns.
- **Niche too broad:** Ask user to narrow to a sub-niche or pick one platform to focus analysis on.
- **No competitors found:** Niche may be too new or too narrow. Broaden one step and re-search.
  If still empty, this itself is a signal — could be a gap opportunity.
- **Competitor is a large media company (Forbes, Wirecutter):** Scale down — these aren't
  replicable. Find indie affiliate sites instead (`web_search "[niche] best [product] blog"`).

## Examples

**Example 1:**
User: "Spy on what affiliate programs income school recommends"
→ web_fetch incomeschool.com, look for affiliate disclosures and outbound links
→ Find: Bluehost, Ezoic, Rank Math, Jasper — extract with confidence levels
→ Map to list.affitor.com programs
→ Output intelligence report with content gaps in their niche

**Example 2:**
User: "What affiliate strategy do top YouTubers use in the AI tools niche?"
→ Find 3-5 AI tools YouTubers via web_search
→ Analyze video descriptions for affiliate links (common pattern: "links below")
→ Extract: most promote 5-10 tools consistently, heavy on comparison content
→ Identify gap: no one doing "best AI tools for [specific job role]" content

**Example 3:**
User: "I'm entering the email marketing niche, help me spy on competitors"
→ Find competitors: emailtooltester.com, emailvendorselection.com, etc.
→ Extract programs: ConvertKit, ActiveCampaign, GetResponse, Brevo
→ Content gap: all sites focus on features, none do "email marketing ROI by industry"
→ Recommend: start with ConvertKit (recurring, high commission), fill the ROI gap

## 4. Expert Skill: content-angle-ranker
> **Path within category:** `skills/research/content-angle-ranker/SKILL.md`


# Content Angle Ranker

You have a keyword. You know the niche. But what specific content should you create?
Which angle, format, and hook will actually perform? This skill answers that question
with data — not gut feeling.

It takes engagement data (from `trending-content-scout` or live research) and ranks
8-12 content angle candidates by a weighted score combining platform fit, competition
level, engagement prediction, and creator fit. The output is a prioritized list with
a clear recommendation and direct handoff to content creation skills.

Think of it as `/plan-ceo-review` from gstack, but for content strategy: "What is
the 10-star version of this content?" — except the answer is backed by engagement data.

## Stage

This skill belongs to Stage S1: Research — but it bridges directly into S2: Content Creation.

## When to Use

- After `trending-content-scout` ran — use its data to pick the best angle
- User has a product/keyword but doesn't know what content to create
- User has multiple content ideas and wants to prioritize by data
- User wants to know: "If I only have time for ONE piece of content, what should it be?"
- Before running any S2 content skill (viral-post-writer, tiktok-script-writer, etc.)

## Input Schema

```yaml
keyword: string               # (required if no scout_data) "AI video tools"
product: object                # (optional) Affiliate product being promoted
  name: string                 # "HeyGen"
  description: string          # What it does
  url: string                  # Product URL or affiliate link
  reward_value: string         # Commission info — never shown in content
platform: string               # (required) Target platform for content creation
                               # "youtube" | "tiktok" | "linkedin" | "x" | "reddit" | "blog"
creator_strengths: string[]    # (optional) What the user is good at
                               # "storytelling" | "technical" | "humor" | "authority" |
                               # "visual" | "data" | "personal_experience"
audience: string               # (optional) Target audience — "beginners", "developers", "small business owners"
time_budget: string            # (optional) "30min" | "2hours" | "1day" — affects difficulty filter
custom_angles: string[]        # (optional) User's own angle ideas to include in ranking
```

**Auto-detection:** If `trending-content-scout` ran earlier in the conversation,
its output is automatically used as the data foundation. No need to pass it explicitly.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Engagement Data

**If `trending-content-scout` output exists in context:**
- Use `pattern_analysis` (winning formats, hooks, engagement benchmarks)
- Use `content_gaps` as angle candidates
- Use `top_content` for competition assessment
- Skip to Step 2

**If no scout data:**
Run a quick scout internally:
1. `web_search "[keyword] site:youtube.com"` → top 10 videos, note formats and view counts
2. `web_search "[keyword] site:tiktok.com"` OR `web_search "[keyword] tiktok viral"` → top TikTok content
3. `web_search "[keyword] site:reddit.com top"` → top Reddit discussions
4. `web_search "[keyword] [platform] best performing"` → meta-analysis of what works
5. Extract: dominant formats, popular hooks, view count ranges, gaps

This takes 30-60 seconds and provides enough signal for angle scoring.

### Step 2: Generate Angle Candidates (8-12)

Generate 8-12 specific content angle candidates. Each angle must be concrete enough
to become a title — not vague ("write about HeyGen") but specific ("HeyGen vs Synthesia:
I tested both for 30 days — honest comparison for solo creators").

**Sources for angles:**

1. **Gap-based angles (from scout data or web_search):**
   - Content gaps: topics nobody has covered well
   - Format gaps: popular topic but missing in a specific format (e.g., comparison exists on YouTube but not TikTok)
   - Audience gaps: existing content targets general audience, specific audience underserved
   - Recency gaps: existing content is outdated, fresh version needed

2. **Pattern-based angles (from winning formats):**
   - Take the winning format and apply it to the keyword
   - Combine the best hook type with the topic
   - Replicate the structure of the highest-engagement content with a fresh perspective

3. **Contrarian angles:**
   - If all content is positive → honest cons angle
   - If all content targets beginners → advanced user angle
   - If all content is listicles → deep single-product dive

4. **User-provided angles (from custom_angles):**
   - Include any angles the user suggested
   - Score them alongside generated candidates — no bias

For each angle, define:

```yaml
Angle:
  title: string               # Specific, could be an actual content title
  angle: string               # Brief description of the angle
  format: string              # "comparison" | "review" | "tutorial" | "listicle" | "demo" | "story" | "reaction" | "explainer"
  hook: string                # The actual hook/opening line
  hook_type: string           # "question" | "shock" | "bold_claim" | "demo_first" | "relatable" | "contrarian"
  source: string              # "gap" | "pattern" | "contrarian" | "user_provided"
```

### Step 3: Score Each Angle

Score every angle on 4 dimensions (1-10 each), then calculate a weighted total:

```
angle_score = (platform_fit × 0.25) + (competition_level × 0.30) +
              (engagement_prediction × 0.30) + (creator_fit × 0.15)
```

**Dimension 1: Platform Fit (weight: 25%)**

How well does this format/hook work on the target platform?

| Format | YouTube | TikTok | LinkedIn | X | Reddit | Blog |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|---|--------|------|
| comparison | 9 | 8 | 7 | 5 | 8 | 9 |
| review | 8 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 9 | 9 |
| tutorial | 9 | 7 | 6 | 3 | 7 | 10 |
| listicle | 7 | 8 | 9 | 8 | 6 | 8 |
| demo | 8 | 10 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 5 |
| story | 6 | 9 | 10 | 8 | 7 | 7 |
| reaction | 7 | 10 | 4 | 6 | 5 | 3 |
| explainer | 8 | 5 | 8 | 6 | 8 | 9 |

Adjust based on actual scout data if available (if comparisons outperform on a platform
where they usually don't, use the real data instead of the default table).

**Dimension 2: Competition Level (weight: 30%)**

How many similar content pieces already exist? Higher score = LESS competition.

```
IF scout data available:
  Count how many top_content pieces match this angle's format + similar topic
  10 = zero similar content found (blue ocean)
  7-9 = 1-3 similar pieces (low competition)
  4-6 = 4-10 similar pieces (moderate competition)
  1-3 = 10+ similar pieces (saturated)
  
IF no scout data:
  web_search for the exact angle title → count results
  Fewer results with exact match = higher score
```

**Dimension 3: Engagement Prediction (weight: 30%)**

How likely is this angle to get high engagement based on data?

```
IF scout data available:
  Look at engagement scores of similar formats and hooks in top_content
  If this angle's format has avg_engagement > median → higher score
  If this angle's hook_type has avg_engagement > median → higher score
  Combine: angle uses top format + top hook → 9-10
  Angle uses average format + average hook → 5-6
  Angle uses underperforming format → 3-4

IF no scout data:
  Use platform defaults and general engagement patterns
  Comparisons generally outperform reviews → 8 vs 6
  Bold claim hooks generally outperform questions → 8 vs 6
```

**Dimension 4: Creator Fit (weight: 15%)**

How well does this angle match the creator's strengths?

```
IF creator_strengths provided:
  "storytelling" → story format, relatable hooks → high fit
  "technical" → tutorial format, demo hooks → high fit
  "humor" → reaction format, relatable hooks → high fit
  "authority" → review format, bold claim hooks → high fit
  "visual" → demo format, demo_first hooks → high fit
  "data" → comparison format, explainer → high fit
  "personal_experience" → story format, reaction → high fit
  
  Match count: 2+ matches → 9-10, 1 match → 6-7, 0 matches → 4-5

IF no creator_strengths:
  Default all angles to 7 (neutral)
```

### Step 4: Rank and Add Difficulty/Time Estimates

Sort angles by `angle_score` descending.

For each angle, estimate:

```yaml
difficulty: string       # "easy" | "medium" | "hard"
estimated_time: string   # "30 min" | "1-2 hours" | "half day" | "full day"
```

Difficulty mapping:
- **easy:** Listicle, simple reaction, short demo, Twitter thread → 30-60 min
- **medium:** Comparison (need 2 products), tutorial with steps, story post → 1-3 hours
- **hard:** Deep review with testing, data-driven explainer, long-form video → 3+ hours

If `time_budget` is provided, flag angles that exceed the budget.

### Step 5: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] At least 8 angles generated with concrete titles (not vague descriptions)
- [ ] Scores are differentiated (not all 7.0-7.5 — spread them out)
- [ ] Top angle is clearly justified by data, not arbitrary
- [ ] At least 2 gap-based angles included (differentiation opportunities)
- [ ] Difficulty estimates are realistic
- [ ] Next steps reference specific downstream skills with parameters

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user.

## 5. Expert Skill: purple-cow-audit
> **Path within category:** `skills/research/purple-cow-audit/SKILL.md`


# Purple Cow Audit

Quality gate for affiliate marketers: score a product's remarkability 1-10 before promoting it. Based on Seth Godin's Purple Cow — if the product isn't remarkable, no amount of marketing skill will make it convert sustainably. The key question: "Would I recommend this to a friend WITHOUT earning a commission?"

## Stage

S1: Research — Evaluating a program's worthiness IS part of research and discovery. This is a quality gate before you invest time creating content, landing pages, and email sequences.

## When to Use

- User is considering promoting a specific product
- User asks "is this product worth promoting?"
- User wants to evaluate product quality before investing time
- User says "purple cow", "remarkable", "audit", "evaluate", "quality check"
- Before investing time in S2-S5 skills for a specific product
- User has a list of programs from `affiliate-program-search` and needs to pick the best

## Input Schema

```yaml
product:                    # REQUIRED
  name: string              # Product name
  url: string               # Product website
  description: string       # OPTIONAL — what it does
  reward_value: string      # OPTIONAL — commission rate
  tags: string[]            # OPTIONAL — categories

comparison_products: string[] # OPTIONAL — competitors to compare against
                              # Default: auto-discovered
```

**Chaining from S1 affiliate-program-search**: If run, evaluate the `recommended_program`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Research the Product

1. `web_search`: `"[product] review 2024 2025"` — find recent reviews
2. `web_search`: `"[product] vs" OR "[product] alternative"` — find competitors
3. `web_search`: `"[product] complaints" OR "[product] problems"` — find issues
4. Check product website for: pricing transparency, unique features, social proof

### Step 2: Score Remarkability

Rate each dimension 1-10:

| Dimension | Question | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| **Uniqueness** | Does it do something no competitor does? | 20% |
| **Quality** | Is it genuinely excellent at its core job? | 20% |
| **Story** | Does using it make you feel/look different? | 15% |
| **Word of mouth** | Would users tell friends unprompted? | 15% |
| **Design** | Is the experience delightful, not just functional? | 10% |
| **Problem fit** | Does it solve a real, painful problem? | 10% |
| **Trust** | Transparent pricing, good support, real social proof? | 10% |

**Composite score** = weighted average (1-10)

### Step 3: Make Recommendation

Based on composite score:
- **8-10: PROMOTE** — This is a Purple Cow. Go all in.
- **6-7: PROMOTE WITH ANGLE** — Good product, needs strong positioning. Identify your unique angle.
- **4-5: CAUTION** — Mediocre product. Only promote if commission is exceptional AND you can add significant value through bonuses.
- **1-3: SKIP** — Not remarkable. Promoting this will damage your reputation. Find an alternative.

### Step 4: Identify Remarkable Angles

For products scoring 6+, identify:
1. The 1-2 features that ARE remarkable (Purple Cow elements)
2. The angles that make it share-worthy
3. The audience segment for whom this IS a Purple Cow (even if not for everyone)

### Step 5: Self-Validation

- [ ] Score is evidence-based (cited reviews, features, data)
- [ ] Recommendation is honest (not inflated by high commission)
- [ ] Remarkable angles are specific (not generic praise)
- [ ] Comparison with competitors is fair
- [ ] The "would I recommend without commission" test was honestly applied

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"
purple_cow_audit:
  product_name: string
  composite_score: number       # 1-10 weighted
  recommendation: string        # "promote" | "promote_with_angle" | "caution" | "skip"

    uniqueness: number
    quality: number
    story: number
    word_of_mouth: number
    design: number
    problem_fit: number
    trust: number

  remarkable_angles: string[]   # What makes it a Purple Cow (for 6+)
  red_flags: string[]           # Concerns identified
  alternative_products: string[] # Better options if score < 6

remarkability_score: number     # Alias for composite_score (for chaining)

chain_metadata:
  skill_slug: "purple-cow-audit"

  suggested_next:
    - "affiliate-program-search"
    - "grand-slam-offer"
    - "viral-post-writer"
    - "monopoly-niche-finder"
```

## Output Format

```
## Purple Cow Audit: [Product Name]

### The Question
Would I recommend [product] to a friend WITHOUT earning a commission?
**Answer:** [Yes/No/With caveats]

### Remarkability Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Uniqueness | X/10 | [specific evidence] |
| Quality | X/10 | [specific evidence] |
| Story | X/10 | [specific evidence] |
| Word of Mouth | X/10 | [specific evidence] |
| Design | X/10 | [specific evidence] |
| Problem Fit | X/10 | [specific evidence] |
| Trust | X/10 | [specific evidence] |
| **Composite** | **X/10** | |

### Recommendation: [PROMOTE / PROMOTE WITH ANGLE / CAUTION / SKIP]

[Reasoning — 2-3 sentences]

### Remarkable Angles (what to emphasize)
1. [Specific remarkable feature/aspect]
2. [Specific remarkable feature/aspect]

### Red Flags (what to be honest about)
1. [Concern]
2. [Concern]

### If Score < 6: Better Alternatives
- [Alternative 1] — [why it's more remarkable]
- [Alternative 2] — [why it's more remarkable]
```

## Error Handling

- **No product provided**: "Tell me the product name and I'll audit its remarkability. Or run `affiliate-program-search` first."
- **Product is too new/no reviews**: Score based on available data, flag low confidence. "Limited data — revisit this audit in 3 months."
- **User disagrees with score**: "The score is a starting framework. If you have personal experience that changes the picture, tell me and I'll adjust."
- **No alternatives found**: Suggest running `affiliate-program-search` in the same category.

## Examples

**Example 1:** "Is HeyGen worth promoting?"
→ Research reviews, features, competitors. Score across 7 dimensions. Result: 8/10 PROMOTE — remarkable for AI avatar quality, unique lip-sync tech, strong word of mouth.

**Example 2:** "Evaluate these 3 programs from my search results"
→ Score all 3 side-by-side. Compare composite scores. Recommend the Purple Cow.

**Example 3:** "Should I promote this random SaaS tool?" (generic tool, many competitors)
→ Research reveals: 5/10 CAUTION — competent but unremarkable. 4 competitors do the same thing. Suggest finding a more remarkable alternative or targeting a micro-audience where it IS remarkable.

## Revenue & Action Plan

### Expected Outcomes
- **Revenue potential**: Choosing an 8+/10 product vs a 5/10 product means 3-5x higher conversion rates. At the same traffic, that's $300-1,500/month vs $100-300/month. Product selection is the highest-leverage decision in affiliate marketing
- **Benchmark**: Products scoring 8+ convert at 3-5% CTR, while 4-5 products convert at 0.5-1%. The difference compounds over months
- **Key metric to track**: EPC (Earnings Per Click) — after 30 days of promotion, compare your EPC against the program's network average. If yours is below average, the product may not resonate with YOUR audience

### Do This Right Now (15 min)
- **If PROMOTE (8-10)**: Run `grand-slam-offer` immediately — design your irresistible offer around the remarkable angles identified. Then start creating content today
- **If PROMOTE WITH ANGLE (6-7)**: Run `monopoly-niche-finder` to find the specific audience segment where this IS remarkable. Don't promote to a general audience
- **If CAUTION/SKIP (1-5)**: Run `affiliate-program-search` to find a better product in the same niche. Don't waste months promoting a mediocre product

### Track Your Results
After promoting for 30 days: check EPC. If below $0.50, re-audit the product — the market may not find it as remarkable as the audit suggested. Switch products early; sunk cost is the biggest affiliate mistake.

> **Next step — copy-paste this prompt:**
> "Design an irresistible offer for [product] using these remarkable angles: [list from audit]" → runs `grand-slam-offer`

## 6. Expert Skill: monopoly-niche-finder
> **Path within category:** `skills/research/monopoly-niche-finder/SKILL.md`


# Monopoly Niche Finder

Find intersection niches where you're the ONLY voice. Based on Peter Thiel's "competition is for losers" — instead of fighting for market share in "AI tools" or "SaaS reviews," cross two domains to create a niche where you're the default authority. Example: "AI video tools for real estate agents" — specific enough to own, broad enough to monetize.

## Stage

S1: Research — Finding your monopoly niche IS research. This happens before you pick a program, before you write content. It's the strategic foundation that makes everything downstream easier.

## When to Use

- User is starting out and hasn't picked a niche yet
- User is in a crowded niche and struggling with competition
- User wants a unique angle for affiliate marketing
- User says "monopoly", "blue ocean", "unique niche", "no competition"
- User has expertise in two domains and wants to combine them
- Before running `affiliate-program-search` to narrow the search space

## Input Schema

```yaml
domain_1: string              # OPTIONAL — first area of expertise/interest
                              # e.g., "real estate", "fitness", "accounting"
                              # Default: ask user

domain_2: string              # OPTIONAL — second area to cross with
                              # e.g., "AI tools", "no-code", "automation"
                              # Default: suggest options

existing_audience: string     # OPTIONAL — who already follows/reads you
                              # e.g., "small business owners", "developers"
                              # Default: none

monetization_goal: string     # OPTIONAL — "affiliate" | "info-product" | "both"
                              # Default: "affiliate"
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Domains

If domains not provided:
1. Ask user about their expertise, work experience, hobbies
2. Ask about their audience (if any)
3. Suggest 3-5 domain pairs based on their profile

If one domain provided, suggest 3-5 complementary domains to cross with.

### Step 2: Generate Intersection Niches

For each domain pair, generate 3-5 intersection niches:

Format: `[Domain 1] × [Domain 2] = [Intersection Niche]`

For each intersection:
1. **Specificity test**: Is this specific enough that you could be the #1 resource?
2. **Size test**: Is the audience large enough to monetize? (at least 10K potential monthly searches)
3. **Passion test**: Could you create 50+ pieces of content about this without burning out?
4. **Monetization test**: Are there affiliate programs in this space?

### Step 3: Validate with Data

For each top intersection niche:
1. `web_search` for `"[intersection niche]" site:reddit.com` — are people asking about this?
2. `web_search` for `"[intersection niche]" blog` — how many dedicated resources exist? (fewer = better)
3. `web_search` for `"[intersection niche]" affiliate program` — monetization potential
4. Check competitor landscape: if top 10 results are big brands → narrow further. If thin content → opportunity.

### Step 4: Score and Rank

Score each niche on:
| Factor | Weight | Scoring |
|---|---|---|
| Monopoly potential | 30% | 1-10: how few competitors |
| Monetization | 25% | 1-10: affiliate program quality |
| Audience size | 20% | 1-10: search volume + community size |
| Your fit | 15% | 1-10: expertise + passion |
| Content potential | 10% | 1-10: can you create 50+ pieces |

### Step 5: Deep Dive Top Niche

For the #1 scored niche:
1. Map 10-15 content topics you could cover
2. Identify 3-5 affiliate programs that fit
3. Describe the "ideal reader" persona
4. Suggest the first 3 pieces of content to create

### Step 6: Self-Validation

- [ ] Top niche has genuinely low competition (verified by search)
- [ ] Affiliate programs exist for this niche
- [ ] Content topics are specific (not generic)
- [ ] Niche is narrow enough to dominate but wide enough to sustain

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"
monopoly_niche:
  domain_1: string
  domain_2: string
  intersection: string          # The winning niche
  monopoly_score: number        # 1-100 composite
  competition_level: string     # "none" | "minimal" | "moderate" | "high"
  audience_size: string         # Estimated monthly search interest
  affiliate_programs: string[]  # Programs that fit this niche

niche_candidates:               # All evaluated niches
  - intersection: string
    score: number
    competition: string
    monetization: string

content_roadmap:
  ideal_reader: string
  first_topics: string[]        # First 3 content pieces
  total_topics: number          # How many topics mapped

chain_metadata:
  skill_slug: "monopoly-niche-finder"
  stage: "research"
  timestamp: string
  suggested_next:
    - "affiliate-program-search"
    - "niche-opportunity-finder"
    - "keyword-cluster-architect"
    - "category-designer"
```

## Output Format

```
## Monopoly Niche Analysis

### Your Domains
- Domain 1: [domain]
- Domain 2: [domain]

### Intersection Niches Evaluated

| # | Intersection | Monopoly | Monetization | Audience | Fit | Content | Score |

| 2 | ... | | | | | | |

### Winner: [Top Niche]

**Why this is a monopoly niche:**
[Explanation — why you can be the ONLY voice here]

**Competition check:**
[What exists today — and why it's not enough]

**Affiliate programs:**
[3-5 programs that fit, with commission data]

**Your ideal reader:**
[Persona description]

### Content Roadmap (first 3 pieces)
1. [Topic] — [why this first]
2. [Topic] — [builds on #1]
3. [Topic] — [establishes authority]

### Next Steps
- Run `affiliate-program-search` filtered to [niche] programs
- Run `keyword-cluster-architect` to map the full content opportunity
- Run `category-designer` to name and own your category
```

## Error Handling

- **No domains provided**: "Tell me about your expertise, work, or interests — I'll help you find where two worlds collide into a monopoly niche."
- **Domains too similar**: "These are in the same space. Try crossing with something unexpected — the magic is in unlikely combinations."
- **No affiliate programs found**: Expand the niche slightly or suggest adjacent programs. "The niche is great for content, but let's find adjacent programs you can promote."
- **Niche too narrow**: "This might be too specific to sustain content. Let me widen the lens slightly..."

## Examples

**Example 1:** "I know real estate and I'm into AI tools"
→ Intersections: "AI tools for real estate agents", "AI property photography", "AI-powered real estate marketing", "Automated real estate content creation", "AI virtual staging tools". Validate each, score, deep-dive the winner.

**Example 2:** "I'm a developer struggling to stand out in the SaaS review space"
→ Cross "developer" with "SaaS": "Developer tools for non-technical founders", "DevOps tools for solo SaaS builders", "API-first marketing tools". Find the gap where dev expertise adds credibility.

**Example 3:** "Find me a niche with no competition"
→ Ask about domains/interests first, then generate intersections, validate with search data, prove low competition with evidence.

## Flywheel Connections

## 7. Expert Skill: traffic-analyzer
> **Path within category:** `skills/research/traffic-analyzer/SKILL.md`


# Traffic Analyzer

Analyze website traffic, engagement, and traffic sources for any domain. Goes beyond
raw data — scores the domain, interprets what the traffic patterns mean for affiliate
promotion, and recommends whether the program is worth your time.

A tool returns numbers. This skill returns a verdict.

**Use cases:**
- Is this affiliate program's website healthy? (High traffic = more brand awareness = easier conversions)
- Where does a competitor get their traffic? (Find channels they're ignoring)
- Compare 2-3 affiliate programs by advertiser website strength
- Validate a niche by checking traffic to the top programs in it

## Stage

This skill belongs to Stage S1: Research

## When to Use

- Before committing to promote an affiliate program — check if the advertiser is legit
- When comparing multiple programs — traffic is a proxy for brand strength
- When `competitor-spy` identifies competitor sites — analyze their traffic sources
- When evaluating a niche — check if the top programs have healthy traffic
- When an advertiser claims "millions of users" — verify with data

## Input Schema

```yaml
domains: string[]             # (required) 1-5 domains to analyze — "heygen.com", "synthesia.io"
compare: boolean              # (optional, default: true if 2+ domains) Side-by-side comparison
focus: string                 # (optional, default: "affiliate") 
                              # "affiliate" — score from promoter perspective
                              # "competitor" — analyze as a competitor site
                              # "advertiser" — evaluate advertiser health
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Traffic Data

**With SimilarWeb API (see `shared/references/social-data-providers.md`):**

If `social_data_config.similarweb` is configured:
- Call SimilarWeb API for each domain
- Returns: global rank, country rank, visits, pages/visit, avg duration, bounce rate, traffic sources

**Without API (web_search fallback):**

For each domain:
1. `web_search "[domain] traffic similarweb"` → often shows rank and visit estimates in snippets
2. `web_search "[domain] site traffic statistics"` → third-party reports
3. `web_search "site:[domain]"` → Google index count as proxy for content depth
4. `web_search "[domain] alexa rank"` OR `"[domain] semrush traffic"` → alternative sources
5. `web_fetch "https://www.similarweb.com/website/[domain]/"` → extract visible data from SimilarWeb free page (may be limited)

Note: web_search data is approximate. SimilarWeb API provides exact metrics.

### Step 2: Analyze Core Metrics

For each domain, analyze and interpret:

**Traffic Volume:**
```yaml
global_rank: number            # Lower = better. <10K = major site, <100K = solid, <1M = niche
country_rank: number           # Rank in primary country
monthly_visits: string         # "1.2M", "350K", "45K"
visits_trend: string           # "growing" | "stable" | "declining" (if historical data available)
```

**Engagement Quality:**
```yaml
pages_per_visit: number        # >3 = good engagement, <2 = bouncy
avg_visit_duration: string     # ">3 min" = engaged, "<1 min" = low quality
bounce_rate: number            # <40% = excellent, 40-60% = normal, >60% = concerning
```

**Traffic Sources Breakdown:**
```yaml
direct: number                 # % — brand strength indicator
search: number                 # % — SEO strength
social: number                 # % — social media presence
referral: number               # % — partnership/affiliate ecosystem
paid: number                   # % — ad spend (high paid = advertiser invests in acquisition)
```

### Step 3: Interpret for Use Case

**For affiliate promoters (`focus: "affiliate"`):**

Score the domain as an affiliate promotion target:

| Signal | Good (8-10) | OK (5-7) | Red Flag (1-4) |
|--------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| Monthly visits | >500K | 50K-500K | <50K |
| Bounce rate | <40% | 40-60% | >70% |
| Search traffic | >30% | 15-30% | <10% (overly dependent on ads) |
| Brand (direct) | >30% | 15-30% | <10% (nobody knows them) |
| Pages/visit | >4 | 2-4 | <2 |

**Why this matters for affiliates:**
- High traffic = people already search for this brand → easier to convert your referrals
- Strong brand (high direct traffic) = trust → higher conversion rate
- Good engagement = product delivers value → lower refund rate → your commissions stick
- Healthy search traffic = sustainable business → long-term commission potential
- High paid traffic = advertiser invests in growth → good sign for program longevity

**For competitor analysis (`focus: "competitor"`):**

- Identify their strongest traffic channel → where are they winning?
- Find their weakest channel → opportunity for you
- Compare bounce rate → are they retaining visitors better than you?
- Check referral traffic → which sites link to them? (potential partnership targets)

**For advertiser evaluation (`focus: "advertiser"`):**

- Is the advertiser's website healthy? (declining traffic = risky to promote)
- Do they invest in marketing? (paid traffic % shows ad budget)
- Is their product sticky? (engagement metrics reveal product quality)
- How established are they? (global rank trajectory)

### Step 4: Generate Traffic Score

Calculate an overall **Traffic Health Score** (0-100):

```
traffic_score = (
  rank_score × 0.20 +           # Based on global rank
  volume_score × 0.25 +          # Based on monthly visits  
  engagement_score × 0.25 +      # Based on bounce rate + pages/visit + duration
  diversity_score × 0.15 +       # Traffic source diversity (not overly dependent on one channel)
  brand_score × 0.15             # Direct traffic % (brand recognition)
)
```

**Score interpretation:**
- **80-100:** Excellent. Strong, established brand. Safe to promote long-term.
- **60-79:** Good. Healthy traffic. Solid promotion candidate.
- **40-59:** Fair. Growing or niche site. Evaluate other factors (commission, product quality).
- **20-39:** Weak. Low traffic or declining. Proceed with caution.
- **0-19:** Red flag. Very low traffic, new, or declining fast. Not recommended unless early-stage with high commission.

### Step 5: Compare (if multiple domains)

If 2+ domains provided, create side-by-side comparison:
- Which has more traffic?
- Which has better engagement?
- Which has more diverse traffic sources?
- Which is growing faster?
- Overall winner with reasoning

### Step 6: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] Data source clearly stated (API vs web_search estimate)
- [ ] Scores are calibrated (not all 8/10 — differentiate clearly)
- [ ] Interpretation matches the focus (affiliate vs competitor vs advertiser)
- [ ] Red flags explicitly called out, not buried
- [ ] Recommendation is actionable and specific

If any check fails, fix before delivering. Do not flag checklist to user.

## 8. Expert Skill: niche-opportunity-finder
> **Path within category:** `skills/research/niche-opportunity-finder/SKILL.md`


# Niche Opportunity Finder

Analyze search demand, competition, and available affiliate programs to surface
untapped niches worth entering. Outputs a scored shortlist with clear reasoning
so beginners can start promoting in under an hour.

## Stage

This skill belongs to Stage S1: Research

## When to Use

- User is new to affiliate marketing and has no niche
- User is unhappy with their current niche and wants alternatives
- User wants to validate a niche idea before investing time
- User asks which niches are trending or low-competition
- User wants to find niches underserved by existing affiliates

## Input Schema

```
{
  interests: string[]       # (optional) Topics user already knows or cares about
  audience: string          # (optional) Who they plan to reach — "beginners", "professionals", "parents"
  platform: string          # (optional) Where they'll publish — "blog", "tiktok", "youtube", "linkedin"
  budget: string            # (optional) "zero" | "low ($0-50/mo)" | "medium ($50-200/mo)"
  goal: string              # (optional) "first $100" | "side income $1k/mo" | "full-time income"
  avoid: string[]           # (optional) Niches or topics to exclude
}
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the User's Situation

Ask (if not already clear from context):
1. Any topics you already know well or are curious about?
2. Where will you publish content? (blog, TikTok, YouTube, newsletter...)
3. What's your income goal in the first 6 months?

If user says "just find me something" → default to: AI/SaaS tools, YouTube or blog,
goal = first $500/mo.

### Step 2: Generate Niche Candidates

Produce 8-12 niche candidates across 3 tiers:

**Tier A — Trending (high demand, growing fast):**
Use `web_search "fastest growing affiliate niches [current year]"` and
`web_search "trending affiliate programs [current year]"` to find niches with
momentum. Look for: AI tools, health tech, fintech, remote work tools, creator economy.

**Tier B — Evergreen (stable demand, proven programs):**
Always-on niches: personal finance, web hosting, email marketing, SEO tools,
fitness/wellness, online education, cybersecurity.

**Tier C — Micro-niches (narrow, low competition, high intent):**
Examples: AI tools for lawyers, budgeting apps for freelancers, SEO for Shopify
stores, productivity tools for ADHD. These are combinations of a vertical + a job
or persona. Use `web_search "[vertical] affiliate programs [persona]"` to discover.

### Step 3: Score Each Niche

Score each candidate on 4 dimensions (1-10 scale each):

| Dimension | Weight | How to Assess |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Search Demand | 30% | `web_search "[niche] how to" — look at result count and autosuggest depth |
| Program Availability | 30% | Search list.affitor.com or `web_search "[niche] affiliate programs"` — count quality programs |
| Competition Level | 25% | Search "[niche] best tools" — how saturated is the top 10? Fewer exact-match affiliate sites = less competition. Score 10 = very low competition |
| Content Potential | 15% | Can tutorials, comparisons, listicles, and reviews be made for this niche easily? |

**Overall score** = weighted average. Cut anything below 5.5.

Verdict: 7.5+ = "High Opportunity" / 5.5-7.4 = "Worth Testing" / <5.5 = "Saturated/Skip"

### Step 4: Validate Top 3 Niches on list.affitor.com

For the top 3 niches, check `list.affitor.com` (see `references/list-affitor-api.md`)
to verify real programs exist with good commission structures:
- At least 3 programs with `reward_value` 20%+ OR `reward_type` cps_recurring
- At least one program with `cookie_days` >= 30
- Programs with `stars_count` > 5 (community-validated quality)

If a niche scores well on demand but has no programs on list.affitor.com, use
`web_search "[niche] affiliate program signup"` to verify alternatives exist.

### Step 5: Build the Opportunity Brief

For the top-ranked niche, produce a one-page opportunity brief (see Output Format).
For runner-up niches, produce summary cards only.

### Step 6: Recommend Next Steps

Map user's chosen niche to the affiliate funnel:
1. Use `affiliate-program-search` to find the best specific program in this niche
2. Use `tiktok-script-writer` or `twitter-thread-writer` for first content
3. Use `commission-calculator` to project first 90 days of income

### Step 7: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] Search demand backed by data (autosuggest depth, result count)
- [ ] Top niche has ≥3 programs with 20%+ commission on list.affitor.com
- [ ] Competition score reflects actual top-10 SERP analysis
- [ ] Content angles are specific and actionable, not generic

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```
{
  output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes

    name: string              # "AI Productivity Tools"
    tier: string              # "Trending" | "Evergreen" | "Micro-niche"
    score: number             # 8.4
    verdict: string           # "High Opportunity"
    why: string               # 2-3 sentence rationale
    example_programs: string[] # ["Notion", "ClickUp", "Reclaim AI"]
    content_angles: string[]  # ["comparison", "workflow walkthrough", "beginner guide"]

**Content angles to start with:**
1. [Angle 1 — specific post/video idea]
2. [Angle 2]
3. [Angle 3]


## Next Steps

1. Run `affiliate-program-search` to find the best [Niche] program on list.affitor.com
2. Run `commission-calculator` to project 90-day earnings
3. Run `tiktok-script-writer` or `twitter-thread-writer` to create your first piece of content
```

## Error Handling

- **No interests provided:** Default to AI/SaaS tools niche. Explain the default.
- **Niche too broad (e.g., "health"):** Break into sub-niches and score each separately. Present as micro-niche grid.
- **Niche too narrow (e.g., "left-handed guitarists who use Linux"):** Widen one dimension and present a spectrum of options.
- **No programs found for top niche:** Still present the niche but flag program gap. Suggest direct brand deals as alternative.
- **User picks a saturated niche:** Don't just say no. Find the micro-niche angle within it that is less saturated.
- **Conflicting interests:** Ask user to pick one dimension (monetization speed vs. passion vs. content ease) and sort by that.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
User: "I want to start affiliate marketing but have no idea what niche to pick"
→ Ask: any interests? what platform? income goal?
→ If no answer: default to AI/SaaS tools on YouTube/TikTok, goal = first $500/mo
→ Generate 10 candidates, score all, return top 3 with detailed brief for #1

**Example 2:**
User: "Is fitness a good niche for affiliate marketing?"
→ Validate fitness niche: high demand, many programs (MyProtein, Noom, Whoop)
→ Flag: highly competitive on Google. Score = 6.2 "Worth Testing"
→ Suggest micro-niches: fitness for new moms, home gym under $500, wearables for runners
→ Score micro-niches — surface the strongest one

**Example 3:**
User: "I know a lot about Notion and productivity tools"
→ Lean into existing knowledge: AI productivity tools, note-taking apps, PKM space
→ Score with "expert authority" bonus — existing knowledge = faster content creation
→ Surface programs: Notion, Obsidian affiliate, ClickUp, Reclaim AI
→ Recommend micro-niche: "AI tools for knowledge workers" — score 8.1

## 9. Expert Skill: list-affitor-program
> **Path within category:** `skills/research/list-affitor-program/SKILL.md`


# Affiliate Program Lister

Research an affiliate program from official sources and produce a verified, publish-ready
listing for [list.affitor.com](https://list.affitor.com). Every number comes from the
program's official affiliate page, network page, or pricing page. No guessing.

## Stage

This skill belongs to Stage S1: Research

## When to Use

- User wants to add an affiliate program to list.affitor.com
- User wants to document a program's commission structure in a standard format
- User found a program and wants to create a shareable profile for other affiliates
- User is contributing to the community directory
- User says "list this program" or "add X to the directory"

## Input Schema

```
{
  program_name: string       # (required) Name of the affiliate program, e.g., "HeyGen"
  affiliate_link: string     # (optional) User's affiliate link to include in the listing
  niche: string              # (optional) Category hint, e.g., "AI video", "email marketing"
}
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Confirm Program and Context

Confirm the program name with the user. Ask:
- Do you have an affiliate link for this program? (optional — used for verification only)
- What niche or category does it fall under? (helps with tagging)

If the user says "just list it" or provides enough context, skip questions and proceed.

### Step 2: Research from Official Sources

Research the program using only official, verifiable sources. Search in this order:

1. **Official affiliate/partner page** — `web_search "[program name] affiliate program"` or
   `web_search "[program name] partner program"`. This is the primary source for commission
   structure, cookie duration, payment terms, and signup link.

2. **Affiliate network page** — If the program runs through a network (ShareASale, CJ,
   Impact, PartnerStack, Rewardful, etc.), find the network listing for additional details.

3. **Official pricing page** — `web_search "[program name] pricing"`. Needed to calculate
   realistic earnings (commission % means nothing without knowing the price).

4. **Credibility signals** — Look for: number of customers, notable clients, funding raised,
   year founded, G2/Capterra rating, social proof. These go in the description.

For each data point, note the source. If a value cannot be verified from official sources,
mark it as "unverified" in the output.

### Step 3: Extract Listing Fields

Fill in the structured listing fields from the research:

| Field | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `name` | Official product name | Exact capitalization from their website |
| `url` | Product homepage | Main website, not affiliate signup page |
| `reward_type` | Affiliate page | One of: `cpc`, `cpl`, `cps_one_time`, `cps_recurring`, `cps_lifetime`, `other` |
| `reward_value` | Affiliate page | e.g., "30%", "$50", "$0.10 per click" |
| `reward_duration` | Affiliate page | For recurring: "12 months", "lifetime", etc. Omit for one-time |
| `cookie_days` | Affiliate page | Number only. If not stated, mark "unverified" and estimate from network norms |
| `tags` | Niche + features | 3-6 lowercase tags, e.g., `["ai", "video", "saas"]` |

**Reward type mapping:**
- "X% of each sale" (one purchase) → `cps_one_time`
- "X% recurring" or "X% for Y months" → `cps_recurring`
- "X% for life of customer" → `cps_lifetime`
- "Pay per lead / free trial signup" → `cpl`
- "Pay per click" → `cpc`
- Anything else → `other` (explain in description)

### Step 4: Write the Description

The description is structured markdown that helps affiliates decide if the program is worth
promoting. Write these sections in order:

**Opening (2-3 sentences)**
What the product does, who it serves, and why affiliates should care. Lead with the value
proposition, not the company history.

**Why Promote This Program**
3-5 bullet points covering: commission rate highlights, cookie duration, payment reliability,
product-market fit, conversion-friendly features (free trial, demo, low friction signup).

**Commission Structure**
A markdown table with all commission tiers if multiple exist:

```
| Plan | Price | Commission | Per Sale | Type |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|------|
| Starter | $29/mo | 30% | $8.70/mo | Recurring |
| Pro | $89/mo | 30% | $26.70/mo | Recurring |
| Enterprise | Custom | 30% | Varies | Recurring |
```

Include: minimum payout threshold, payment methods (PayPal, wire, etc.), payment frequency
(monthly, net-30, etc.) if found.

**Target Audiences**
Who can promote this product effectively. List 3-5 specific audience types with brief
reasoning, e.g., "YouTube creators making tutorial content — visual product, easy to demo."

**Earning Potential**
Realistic earnings at three traffic levels using conservative conversion assumptions
(2% CTR, 2% conversion rate):

```
| Monthly Traffic | Est. Sales | Monthly Earnings | Annual Earnings |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| 5,000 visitors | 2 | $X | $X |
| 20,000 visitors | 8 | $X | $X |
| 100,000 visitors | 40 | $X | $X |
```

For recurring programs, show month-12 compounded earnings, not just month-1.

**Why It Converts**
2-3 sentences on what makes this product easy to sell: free tier, strong brand recognition,
low-commitment entry point, visual demo potential, etc.

**Honest Limitations**
2-3 bullet points on real drawbacks. Every program has them. Examples: short cookie window,
high competition from other affiliates, niche audience only, high price point limits
conversions, payout threshold too high for beginners.

### Step 5: Verify Affiliate Link (If Provided)

If the user provided an affiliate link:
- Check that the domain matches the program's known affiliate tracking domain
- Check for expected URL parameters (ref=, aff=, via=, etc.)
- Flag if the link looks malformed or suspicious
- Do NOT click the link or test it — just validate the format

### Step 6: Assemble Output

Present the output in two clearly separated parts:
1. **Listing Fields** — structured data ready for API submission
2. **Description** — the full markdown content

### Step 7: Optional API Submission

If the user wants to submit the listing directly:

```
POST https://list.affitor.com/api/v1/programs
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>

{
  "name": "...",
  "url": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "reward_type": "...",
  "reward_value": "...",
  "reward_duration": "...",
  "cookie_days": 30,
  "tags": ["...", "..."]
}
```

If no API key is available, format the output so the user can copy-paste it into the
list.affitor.com submission form.

### Step 8: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] `name` matches official product name (exact capitalization)
- [ ] `reward_value` comes from the official affiliate page, not estimated
- [ ] `reward_type` uses one of the allowed enum values
- [ ] `cookie_days` is a number from official source or explicitly marked "unverified"
- [ ] Commission table math is correct (price x percentage = per-sale amount)
- [ ] Earning potential uses conservative assumptions (2% CTR, 2% CR) not optimistic ones
- [ ] Honest Limitations section contains real drawbacks, not filler
- [ ] No data was hallucinated — every number traces to a source

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the
user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

Other skills consume these fields from conversation context:

```
{
  output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
  listing: {
    name: string              # "HeyGen"
    url: string               # "https://heygen.com"
    description: string       # Full markdown description (all sections)
    reward_type: string       # "cps_recurring" — enum: cpc, cpl, cps_one_time, cps_recurring, cps_lifetime, other
    reward_value: string      # "30%" or "$50"
    reward_duration: string   # "12 months" | "lifetime" | null (for one-time)
    cookie_days: number       # 60
    tags: string[]            # ["ai", "video", "saas"]
  }
  sources: {
    affiliate_page: string    # URL of official affiliate page
    pricing_page: string      # URL of pricing page
    network: string | null    # "PartnerStack", "ShareASale", etc.
  }
  verification: {
    all_fields_verified: boolean  # true if every field from official source
    unverified_fields: string[]   # ["cookie_days"] if any field could not be confirmed
  }
}
```

## Output Format

```
## Listing Fields

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | [Product Name] |
| URL | [https://product.com] |
| Reward Type | [cps_recurring] |
| Reward Value | [30%] |
| Reward Duration | [12 months] |
| Cookie Days | [60] |
| Tags | [ai, video, saas] |

**Sources:** Affiliate page: [URL] | Pricing page: [URL] | Network: [Name or "Direct"]


**Ready to submit?** Copy the Listing Fields above into list.affitor.com, or use the API
with your API key.
```

## Error Handling

- **Program has no affiliate program:** Tell the user clearly. Suggest checking back later
  or searching for similar programs that do offer affiliates. Do not fabricate commission data.
- **Affiliate page is behind a login wall:** Note that commission details could not be
  verified from public sources. Use network listing or trusted third-party sources as
  fallback. Mark unverified fields explicitly.
- **Data is unclear or conflicting:** When sources disagree (e.g., affiliate page says 20%
  but network says 25%), note both values and flag the discrepancy. Let the user decide
  which to use.
- **Program recently changed terms:** If the affiliate page mentions "updated" or "new"
  commission rates, note the date if available and flag that terms may change.
- **Pricing is usage-based or custom:** Use the most common plan tier for earning
  calculations. Note the assumption. For enterprise-only pricing, use "Contact sales" and
  skip per-sale calculations for that tier.
- **Cookie duration not stated:** Mark as "unverified" and note the network default
  (ShareASale: typically 30d, Impact: varies, PartnerStack: typically 90d). Do not guess.

## Examples

**Example 1: SaaS with recurring commission**
User: "List HeyGen's affiliate program"
- Search official affiliate page → 30% recurring, 60-day cookie, via PartnerStack
- Pricing page → Creator $29/mo, Business $89/mo, Enterprise custom
- Build commission table: Creator = $8.70/mo, Business = $26.70/mo
- Earning potential at 5K visitors: ~2 sales/mo = $17-53/mo (month 1), compounding
- Tags: ai, video, saas, content-creation
- Limitations: competitive niche, product requires learning curve

**Example 2: One-time commission program**
User: "Add Bluehost affiliate program to the list"
- Search → $65+ per signup (one-time), 90-day cookie, direct program
- Pricing → Basic $2.95/mo, Plus $5.45/mo, Choice Plus $5.45/mo
- reward_type: cps_one_time, reward_value: "$65+"
- Earning potential: straightforward per-sale math, no compounding
- Tags: hosting, wordpress, web-hosting, beginner-friendly
- Limitations: saturated market, aggressive competitor affiliates, low-margin hosting

**Example 3: Program with unverifiable data**
User: "Create a listing for this new AI tool I found — ToolXYZ"
- Search affiliate page → behind login, cannot verify commission
- Network listing found on ShareASale → 15% recurring, cookie not specified
- Mark cookie_days as "unverified", note ShareASale default is typically 30 days

## Quality Gate

Before marking this skill's output as complete:

1. Every commission number traces to an official source URL
2. The `reward_type` is a valid enum value from the list.affitor.com schema
3. Earning potential math is correct and uses conservative assumptions
4. The description contains all required sections (Opening, Why Promote, Commission Table, Target Audiences, Earning Potential, Why It Converts, Honest Limitations)
5. At least one real limitation is listed — no "this program is perfect" outputs
6. Unverified fields are explicitly flagged, never silently estimated
7. Tags are lowercase, 3-6 items, and relevant to the program's niche

## 10. Expert Skill: affiliate-program-search
> **Path within category:** `skills/research/affiliate-program-search/SKILL.md`


# Affiliate Program Search

Help affiliate marketers research, evaluate, and pick winning programs to promote.
Data source: [list.affitor.com](https://list.affitor.com) — Affitor's community-driven affiliate program directory.

## Stage

This skill belongs to Stage S1: Research

## When to Use

- User wants to find affiliate programs to promote
- User wants to compare two or more affiliate programs
- User asks about commission rates, cookie duration, or earning potential
- User mentions list.affitor.com
- User is new to affiliate marketing and needs a starting point

## Input Schema

```
{
  niche: string             # (optional, default: "AI/SaaS tools") Category or niche interest
  commission_pref: string   # (optional, default: "recurring, 20%+") Commission preference
  audience: string          # (optional, default: "content creators") Target audience type
  platform: string          # (optional, default: "any") Platform they'll promote on
  compare: string[]         # (optional) Specific programs to compare head-to-head
}
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand What the User Wants

Ask (if not clear from context):
- Niche/category interest? (AI tools, SEO, video, writing, automation...)
- Commission preference? (recurring vs one-time, minimum %)
- Audience type? (developers, marketers, beginners, enterprise...)
- Platform they'll promote on? (blog, LinkedIn, YouTube, X...)

If user says "just find me something good" → default to: AI/SaaS tools, recurring commission, 20%+, content creator audience.

### Step 2: Search list.affitor.com

See `references/list-affitor-api.md` for integration methods.

Two methods available:
- **API (preferred):** `GET /api/v1/programs` with API key auth — structured data, filterable
- **Web fetch (fallback):** `web_search "site:list.affitor.com [category]"` then `web_fetch` the page

Extract for each program: `name`, `reward_value`, `reward_type`, `cookie_days`, `stars_count`, `tags`, `description`.

### Step 3: Score Programs

Apply the scoring framework from `references/scoring-criteria.md`.

Score each program on 5 dimensions (1-10 scale):
1. **Earning Potential** (30%) — commission %, recurring vs one-time, product price
2. **Content Potential** (25%) — visual demo, free tier, content angles
3. **Market Demand** (20%) — search volume, trend direction, market size
4. **Competition Level** (15%) — fewer affiliates promoting = higher score
5. **Trust Factor** (10%) — product quality, reputation, stars on list.affitor.com

Overall = weighted average. Verdict: 7.5+ "Strong Pick" / 5.5-7.4 "Worth Testing" / <5.5 "Skip".

For dimensions that require external data (Market Demand, Competition Level), use `web_search` to check Google results count for "[product] review" and "[product] affiliate" queries.

### Step 4: Present Recommendation

### Step 5: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] All scored programs have `reward_value` from API data, not hallucinated
- [ ] `cookie_days` is numeric and from API response
- [ ] Top Pick verdict matches score threshold (≥7.5 = Strong Pick, ≥6 = Worth Considering)
- [ ] Market Demand and Competition scores cite the search query used
- [ ] Stale data (>6 months) is flagged with warning

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

Other skills (viral-post-writer, affiliate-blog-builder, etc.) consume these fields from conversation context:

```
{
  output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
  recommended_program: {
    name: string              # "HeyGen"
    slug: string              # "heygen"
    reward_value: string      # "30%"
    reward_type: string       # "cps_recurring"
    reward_duration: string   # "12 months"
    cookie_days: number       # 60
    description: string       # Short product description
    tags: string[]            # ["ai", "video"]
    url: string               # Product website
  }
  score: {
    overall: number           # 8.2
    verdict: string           # "Strong Pick"
    reasoning: string         # Why this is the top pick
  }
  runner_up: Program | null   # Same structure, second choice
  all_scored: ProgramScore[]  # Full list of scored programs
}
```

## Output Format

```
## Programs Found

| Program | Commission | Type | Cookie | Stars | Score |
|---------|-----------|------|--------|-------|-------|
| HeyGen  | 30%       | Recurring | 60d | ⭐ 42 | 8.2/10 |
| ...     | ...       | ...  | ...    | ...   | .../10 |

## Top Pick: [Program Name]

**Why:** [2-3 sentences explaining why this is the best fit]

| Dimension | Score | Note |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Earning Potential | 8/10 | 30% recurring on $24-48/mo |
| Content Potential | 9/10 | Visual AI video, easy to demo |
| Market Demand | 8/10 | AI video trending, high search volume |
| Competition | 6/10 | Growing number of affiliates |
| Trust Factor | 8/10 | Strong brand, 42 stars on list.affitor.com |
| **Overall** | **8.2/10** | **Strong Pick** |

## Runner-up: [Program Name]

**Why:** [1-2 sentences]

## Next Steps

1. Sign up for [Program] affiliate program → [search for signup page]
2. Run `viral-post-writer` to create content for this product
3. Run `affiliate-blog-builder` to write a review post
```

## Error Handling

- **API unavailable:** Fall back to web_fetch method (see `references/list-affitor-api.md` Method 2)
- **No programs match criteria:** Broaden search (remove strictest filter first), explain to user what was relaxed
- **Stale data (program updated_at > 6 months):** Flag with "Data may be outdated, verify on product website"
- **User gives no criteria:** Use defaults (AI/SaaS, recurring, 20%+, content creator audience)
- **Program not on list.affitor.com:** Use `web_search` to find program details directly, still apply scoring framework

## Examples

**Example 1:**
User: "I want to promote AI video tools, commission recurring, at least 20%"
→ Search list.affitor.com for programs tagged "ai" or "video"
→ Filter: reward_type = cps_recurring, reward_value ≥ 20%
→ Score and rank: HeyGen, Synthesia, ElevenLabs, InVideo AI...
→ Recommend top pick with full scorecard

**Example 2:**
User: "Compare HeyGen vs Synthesia for my LinkedIn audience"
→ Fetch both from list.affitor.com
→ Score both, emphasize Content Potential for LinkedIn
→ Side-by-side comparison table + recommendation
→ Note: LinkedIn audience = B2B, weight higher-price products

**Example 3:**
User: "I'm a beginner, what should I promote first?"
→ Default criteria: AI/SaaS, recurring, easy-to-demo products
→ Weight beginner-friendly factors: free tier, low payout threshold, strong brand
→ Recommend program with easiest path to first commission

## 11. Expert Skill: trending-content-scout
> **Path within category:** `skills/research/trending-content-scout/SKILL.md`


# Trending Content Scout

Scan YouTube, TikTok, X, and Reddit for top-performing content by real engagement data.
Find winning formats, hooks, and content gaps — **before** you create anything. Stop
guessing what works. See what's already winning, then build on proven patterns.

This skill is the **data foundation** for the entire content pipeline. Run it first,
then feed its output into `content-angle-ranker`, `viral-post-writer`, `tiktok-script-writer`,
or any S2/S3 content skill.

## Stage

This skill belongs to Stage S1: Research

## When to Use

- Before creating any content for a keyword or niche
- When entering a new niche and need to understand what content works
- When comparing engagement across platforms for a topic
- When looking for content gaps competitors haven't filled
- When benchmarking your existing content against what's performing
- As the first step in any content creation workflow (before S2 skills)

## Input Schema

```yaml
keyword: string               # (required) Search keyword — "AI video tools", "email marketing tips"
platforms: string[]            # (optional, default: ["youtube", "tiktok"])
                               # Options: "youtube" | "tiktok" | "x" | "reddit"
sort_by: string                # (optional, default: "engagement_score")
                               # Options: "views" | "likes" | "engagement_score" | "recency"
time_range: string             # (optional, default: "30d") "7d" | "30d" | "90d" | "all"
limit: number                  # (optional, default: 20) Max content pieces to analyze
product: object                # (optional) Specific product to focus on
  name: string                 # "HeyGen"
  url: string                  # "https://heygen.com"
```

No `api_config` needed in input — skills auto-detect configuration from conversation
context, project settings, or CLAUDE.md. See `shared/references/social-data-providers.md`
for setup instructions.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Data Source

Check if the user has API configuration available:

```
IF social_data_config exists in context/settings for a platform:
  → Use configured API for that platform
  → Structured data: exact views, likes, comments, shares
  
ELSE (default — no API):
  → Use web_search + web_fetch
  → Still effective — see fallback methods below
```

**API mode** (when configured):

For each platform in `platforms`:
- YouTube: Search API → get video list → Details API → get statistics (views, likes, comments)
- TikTok: Search API → get video list with stats (playCount, diggCount, commentCount, shareCount)
- X: Search API → get tweets with public_metrics (impressions, likes, retweets, replies)
- Reddit: Search API → get posts with score and comment count

See `shared/references/social-data-providers.md` for specific API endpoints and config.

**web_search fallback** (no API — default):

```
For YouTube:
  web_search "[keyword] site:youtube.com" → top 10-15 video results
  For each result: extract title, channel, view count from search snippet
  Optional: web_fetch individual video pages for likes/comments (slower)

For TikTok:
  web_search "[keyword] tiktok" → find popular TikTok content
  web_search "[keyword] site:tiktok.com" → direct TikTok results
  Extract: titles, creators, approximate view counts from snippets

For X:
  web_search "[keyword] site:x.com" OR "[keyword] site:twitter.com" → top tweets
  Extract: tweet text, author, engagement signals from snippets

For Reddit:
  web_search "[keyword] site:reddit.com" → top Reddit discussions
  web_fetch top results → extract upvotes, comments from page
  web_search "reddit [keyword] top upvoted" → find popular threads
```

Note which data source was used — include in output for transparency.

### Step 2: Collect and Normalize Data

For each content piece found, extract and normalize into a standard schema:

```yaml
ContentItem:
  title: string                # Video title, tweet text (first line), post title
  url: string                  # Direct link to content
  platform: string             # "youtube" | "tiktok" | "x" | "reddit"
  creator: string              # Channel name, @handle, username
  views: number                # View/impression count (0 if unavailable)
  likes: number                # Like/upvote count (0 if unavailable)
  comments: number             # Comment/reply count (0 if unavailable)
  shares: number               # Share/retweet count (0 if unavailable)
  published_date: string       # ISO date or relative ("3 days ago")
  duration: string             # Video duration ("2:34") — video only
  engagement_score: number     # Calculated — see formula below
  content_format: string       # Detected format (see classification below)
  hook_type: string            # Detected hook style (see classification below)
```

**Engagement Score Formula** (consistent across all Affitor skills):

```
engagement_score = (likes × 2 + comments × 3 + shares × 5) / max(views, 1) × 1000
```

Platform-specific adjustments:
- **Reddit:** `(score × 2 + num_comments × 3) / max(score, 1) × 1000` (no share count)
- **X:** Use retweets as shares, replies as comments
- **YouTube:** Estimate shares as `comments × 0.5` (not available via most APIs)
- **web_search fallback:** If only views are available, use `views` as the ranking signal and note that engagement_score is estimated

See `shared/references/social-data-providers.md` for full formula documentation.

**Content Format Classification:**

Detect format from title and description:
- **comparison:** Contains "vs", "versus", "compared to", "X or Y", "better than"
- **review:** Contains "review", "honest review", "worth it", "my experience"
- **tutorial:** Contains "how to", "step by step", "guide", "tutorial", "walkthrough"
- **listicle:** Contains "top X", "best X", "X tools", "X ways", numbers in title
- **reaction:** Contains "I tried", "testing", "first time using", "is it worth"
- **story:** Contains "how I", "my journey", "I made $X", personal narrative
- **demo:** Contains "demo", "showing", "watch me use", "in action"
- **explainer:** Contains "what is", "explained", "why you need", "everything about"

**Hook Type Classification:**

Detect from first sentence/title:
- **question:** Starts with or contains a question
- **shock:** Contains surprising numbers, "you won't believe", extreme claims
- **bold_claim:** "This replaced X", "The only tool you need", definitive statements
- **demo_first:** Starts with showing a result or end product
- **relatable:** "POV:", "When you...", shared experience pattern
- **contrarian:** "Stop using X", "X is overrated", against conventional wisdom

### Step 3: Sort and Rank

Sort all collected content by the chosen `sort_by` parameter:

- **engagement_score** (default): Best for finding content that resonates regardless of creator size
- **views**: Best for finding content with broadest reach
- **likes**: Best for finding content people actively endorse
- **recency**: Best for finding what's working RIGHT NOW

Take top `limit` results after sorting.

### Step 4: Analyze Patterns

From the top content, extract actionable patterns:

**Format Analysis:**
```
For each content_format in top results:
  count: how many of top 20 use this format
  avg_engagement: average engagement_score for this format
  best_example: highest engagement content in this format
```

**Hook Analysis:**
```
For each hook_type in top results:
  count: how many use this hook
  avg_engagement: average engagement_score
  best_example: highest engagement content with this hook
```

**Duration Analysis (video platforms only):**
```
Group videos by duration buckets:
  <30s, 30-60s, 60-120s, 2-5min, 5-10min, 10-20min, 20min+
For each bucket: count and average engagement
→ Identify optimal duration range
```

**Creator Analysis:**
```
For each unique creator in top results:
  content_count: how many pieces in top results
  avg_engagement: average engagement score
  platforms: which platforms they're on
  dominant_format: their most-used format
```

**Gap Analysis:**

This is the most strategically valuable output. Look for:

1. **Format gaps:** If 90% of top content is reviews, comparisons are underserved
2. **Platform gaps:** If YouTube is saturated but TikTok has few results → TikTok opportunity
3. **Angle gaps:** Common user questions (visible in comments/replies) that no top content addresses
4. **Audience gaps:** All content targets advanced users → beginner content is a gap
5. **Recency gaps:** Top content is 6+ months old → fresh take on same topic is an opportunity
6. **Honesty gaps:** All content is positive/promotional → honest cons/limitations review is a gap

For gap analysis with web_search fallback:
- `web_search "[keyword] reddit questions"` → find unanswered user questions
- `web_search "[keyword] alternatives nobody talks about"` → find underserved angles

### Step 5: Calculate Engagement Benchmark

Set benchmark ranges so user knows what "good" looks like:

```yaml
engagement_benchmark:
  sample_size: number           # how many content pieces analyzed
  median_views: number          # 50th percentile views
  median_engagement_score: number
  top_10_percent_threshold:
    views: number               # views needed to be in top 10%
    engagement_score: number    # engagement_score needed for top 10%
  platform_averages:            # per-platform breakdown
    youtube:
      median_views: number
      median_engagement: number
    tiktok:
      median_views: number
      median_engagement: number
```

### Step 6: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] Data source is clearly stated (API vs web_search)
- [ ] Engagement scores are calculated consistently using the standard formula
- [ ] Content format and hook classifications are based on actual title/description analysis, not guesses
- [ ] Gap analysis includes at least 3 specific, actionable gaps
- [ ] Benchmark numbers are derived from actual data, not made up
- [ ] Recommendations connect to specific downstream skills

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user.

  platform: string            # (optional) "blog" | "youtube" | "tiktok" | "email" | "twitter"
  scenario: string            # (optional, default: "realistic") "conservative" | "realistic" | "optimistic"
  goal: string                # (optional) Target income, e.g., "$500/mo" or "$1000/mo"
  time_horizon: string        # (optional, default: "90 days") "30 days" | "90 days" | "12 months"
}
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Program Details

If program details are missing, pull from list.affitor.com (see `references/list-affitor-api.md`).

Key fields to extract: `reward_value`, `reward_type`, `cookie_days`.

If `avg_product_price` is not provided and `reward_type` is percentage-based, estimate it:
- Use `web_search "[program name] pricing"` to find the most common paid plan price
- For SaaS: use the mid-tier plan (e.g., $49/mo on a $19/$49/$99 structure)
- Note the assumption in output so user can adjust

For `cps_recurring` programs, establish payout duration:
- "Lifetime" = commissions paid as long as customer stays (most valuable)
- "12 months" = commissions paid for customer's first year
- "First purchase only" = functionally the same as one-time despite being subscription

### Step 2: Gather Traffic Estimates

If traffic data is not provided, prompt the user OR use platform benchmarks:

| Channel | Benchmark Ranges |
|---------|-----------------|
| New blog (0-6 months) | 500-2,000 visitors/mo |
| Growing blog (6-18 months) | 2,000-20,000 visitors/mo |
| Established blog (18+ months) | 20,000-200,000+ visitors/mo |
| YouTube channel (<1K subs) | 200-2,000 views/mo |
| YouTube channel (1K-10K subs) | 2,000-50,000 views/mo |
| TikTok (<10K followers) | 1,000-20,000 views/video |
| Twitter/X (<5K followers) | 50-500 impressions/tweet |
| Email list (<1K subscribers) | 200-400 opens/send |
| Email list (1K-10K subscribers) | 2,000-7,000 opens/send |

If user won't provide traffic, use "realistic" scenario benchmarks for their stated
platform and growth stage.

### Step 3: Apply Conversion Rate Assumptions

Use these industry-standard conversion rates as defaults. Adjust based on traffic quality
("buyer intent" content converts 5-10x better than informational content):

| Platform + Content Type | Click-through Rate | Affiliate Conversion |
|------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Blog — product review | 3-6% | 2-5% |
| Blog — best-of listicle | 1.5-3% | 1-3% |
| Blog — tutorial/how-to | 0.5-1.5% | 0.5-2% |
| YouTube — dedicated review | 5-10% | 3-6% |
| YouTube — tutorial with mention | 1-3% | 1-3% |
| TikTok — product demo | 0.5-2% (bio link) | 0.5-2% |
| Email — dedicated send | 10-20% | 3-8% |
| Twitter/X — thread CTA | 0.5-2% | 0.5-2% |

For scenario multipliers:
- Conservative: use lower bound of each range
- Realistic: use midpoint
- Optimistic: use upper bound

### Step 4: Calculate Monthly and Projected Earnings

**Formula:**

```
Monthly clicks = Monthly visitors × Click-through rate
Monthly conversions = Monthly clicks × Affiliate conversion rate
Monthly commission = Monthly conversions × Commission per sale

Commission per sale:
  - Percentage-based: avg_product_price × (reward_value / 100)
  - Fixed: reward_value (as number)

For recurring (monthly SaaS) over time_horizon:
  Month 1 revenue = Month 1 conversions × commission_per_sale
  Month 2 revenue = (Month 1 conversions + Month 2 conversions) × commission_per_sale
  Month N = sum of all active subscribers × commission_per_sale
  [Cap at reward_duration if not lifetime]
```

Calculate for each program:
- Monthly commission at current traffic
- Cumulative commission at 30, 90, 180, 365 days
- Visitors needed to hit user's income goal (if provided)
- Time to first commission (assuming current traffic growth)

### Step 5: Side-by-Side Comparison (Multiple Programs)

If 2+ programs are provided, produce a comparison table:
- Sort by 12-month projected earnings (highest first)
- Flag programs where recurring vs. one-time makes a dramatic difference
- Call out programs with short cookie windows — lower conversion rates assumed
- Note programs with minimum payout thresholds that could delay first payment

### Step 6: Reverse Calculation (If Goal Provided)

If user states an income goal (e.g., "I want $500/mo"), calculate:
- Visitors/month needed to hit that goal with each program
- Number of sales/leads needed per month
- How long to reach that traffic level (using typical affiliate blog growth curves:
  months 1-6 = slow, months 7-12 = acceleration, year 2 = compounding)

### Step 7: Sanity Check and Context

Add context so user isn't misled by numbers:
1. These are projections, not guarantees. Real results vary significantly.
2. High-quality, buying-intent traffic converts 3-5x better than general traffic.
3. First sales often take 2-3 months even with good traffic (cookie window, indecision).
4. Recurring programs feel slow at first but compound — show the Year 1 vs Year 2 difference.

### Step 8: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] Commission math is correct (% × price × conversions)
- [ ] Recurring compounding calculated correctly over 12 months
- [ ] CTR and conversion rate within industry benchmarks (1-5% CTR, 1-3% CR)
- [ ] Unrealistic goals flagged honestly with required traffic numbers
- [ ] One-time vs recurring distinction clear in projections

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```
{
  output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
  projections: [
    {
      program_name: string         # "HeyGen"

    }
  ]
  assumptions: {
    monthly_visitors: number

    scenario: string
    avg_product_price: number | null
  }
  top_program: string      # Name of highest-earning program at 12 months
  insight: string          # 2-3 sentence key takeaway
}
```

## Output Format

```
## Commission Calculator: [Program(s)]

### Assumptions Used

| Input | Value | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Monthly visitors | [X] | [User-provided / estimated for [platform]] |
| Click-through rate | [X%] | [Platform benchmark — scenario] |
| Affiliate conversion | [X%] | [Platform benchmark — scenario] |
| Product price | $[X]/mo | [User-provided / web research] |
| Scenario | [Conservative / Realistic / Optimistic] | — |


### To Hit Your Goal of $[X]/mo

| Program | Sales Needed/Mo | Visitors Needed/Mo | Est. Time to Reach |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| [Program A] | [X] | [X] | [X months] |
| [Program B] | [X] | [X] | [X months] |


## Next Steps

1. Run `affiliate-program-search` to verify these programs are on list.affitor.com
2. Run `niche-opportunity-finder` if you want to compare across niches, not just programs
3. Start creating content — your first sale typically comes at [estimated timeframe]
```

## Error Handling

- **No traffic data provided:** Use conservative benchmarks and label them clearly.
  Ask user for rough estimate ("Do you have any traffic yet, or are you starting from zero?")
- **Commission is percentage but no product price:** Use web_search to estimate.
  If still unknown, run calculator with $50, $100, $200 placeholders and show sensitivity.
- **Program not found on list.affitor.com:** Use web_search to find official affiliate
  program page. Extract commission from there.
- **Unrealistic goal stated (e.g., "$10K/month in 30 days"):** Complete the calculation,
  then honestly flag the traffic required (e.g., "This would require 2M visitors/month —
  more realistic in year 2-3 with consistent publishing.")
- **One-time vs. recurring confusion:** Always clarify the distinction. Show side-by-side
  year 1 earnings for a hypothetical one-time equivalent vs. recurring to illustrate.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
User: "How much can I make promoting HeyGen with a 5,000 visitor/month blog?"
→ Fetch HeyGen data: 30% recurring, 60-day cookie
→ Estimate: $39/mo avg plan × 30% = $11.70/conversion
→ 5,000 visitors × 3% CTR × 3% conversion = 4.5 sales/mo = $52.65/mo at month 1
→ By month 12 (compounding): ~$280/mo steady state
→ Year 1 total: ~$1,890

**Example 2:**
User: "Compare earnings: ConvertKit vs Mailchimp affiliate, I have 2,000 email subscribers"
→ Email channel: 15% open rate, 15% CTR on dedicated send, 5% conversion
→ ConvertKit: $29/mo avg plan, 30% recurring → $8.70/conversion
→ Mailchimp: one-time 20% up to $150 per referral (verify via web_search)
→ Calculate both at 90d and 12m. Show compounding advantage of ConvertKit.

**Example 3:**
User: "I want to make $1,000/month from affiliate marketing, how long will it take?"
→ Ask: what niche/programs? what platform? current traffic?
→ If starting from zero: model blog growth curve (months 1-6 = 0-2K visitors)
→ With realistic programs (30% recurring SaaS): need ~8,000-15,000 visitors/mo
→ Typical timeline: 8-14 months from zero to $1K/mo with consistent publishing

# Grand Slam Offer

Design affiliate offers so good people feel stupid saying no. Uses the Hormozi Value Equation: **Value = Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood ÷ Time Delay ÷ Effort & Sacrifice**. Deconstructs why someone should click YOUR link over any other affiliate's.

## Stage

S4: Landing — The offer IS the landing page's job. Before writing HTML or copy, you need an offer framework that makes the conversion inevitable.

## When to Use

- User wants to differentiate their affiliate promotion from every other affiliate
- User asks "why would someone buy through MY link?"
- User is about to create a landing page and needs the offer angle first
- User wants to increase conversion rates on an existing promotion
- User says anything like "offer", "value proposition", "irresistible", "Hormozi"
- User has a product from S1 and wants to craft the positioning before S4 landing page

## Input Schema

```yaml
product:                    # REQUIRED — the affiliate product
  name: string              # Product name
  description: string       # What it does
  reward_value: string      # Commission (e.g., "30% recurring")
  url: string               # Affiliate link URL
  pricing: string           # Product price or pricing page URL
  tags: string[]            # e.g., ["ai", "video", "saas"]

target_audience: string     # OPTIONAL — who you're targeting
                            # Default: inferred from product tags

bonuses: string[]           # OPTIONAL — bonuses you're already offering
                            # Default: none (will suggest bonuses)

competitors: string[]       # OPTIONAL — competing products
                            # Default: auto-researched
```

**Chaining from S1**: If `affiliate-program-search` was run earlier, automatically pick up `recommended_program` as the `product` input.

**Chaining from S1 purple-cow-audit**: If `purple-cow-audit` was run, use `remarkability_score` and `remarkable_angles` to inform the offer.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context

If product data is available from S1 chaining, use it directly. Otherwise:

1. Use `web_search` to research: `"[product name] features pricing review"`
2. Gather: name, pricing tiers, key features, target audience, top 3 competitors
3. If `target_audience` not provided, infer from product positioning and tags

### Step 2: Apply Value Equation

Read `shared/references/offer-frameworks.md` for the Hormozi framework.

For each component of the Value Equation, score the product 1-10 and identify leverage points:

**Dream Outcome (maximize)**
- What is the #1 transformation the audience wants?
- What does life look like AFTER using this product?
- Frame in terms of identity: "Become the person who..."

**Perceived Likelihood (maximize)**
- What proof exists? (case studies, user count, reviews)
- What specific numbers can you cite?
- What demonstration can you offer? (your own results, screenshots)

**Time Delay (minimize)**
- How fast can they see first results?
- What quick wins does the product offer?
- Can you accelerate with your bonuses? (templates, setup guide)

**Effort & Sacrifice (minimize)**
- What's the learning curve?
- What do they have to give up?
- Can you reduce effort with done-for-you assets?

### Step 3: Design the Offer Stack

Build the complete offer:

1. **Core product** — the affiliate product itself with reframed positioning
2. **Your unique angle** — why YOU are the right person to recommend this
3. **Bonus suggestions** — 3-5 bonuses that address the weakest Value Equation components
4. **Guarantee suggestion** — your personal guarantee on top of the product's
5. **Urgency element** — ethical, real urgency (if applicable)

### Step 4: Write Offer Copy

Create ready-to-use copy blocks:
- **Headline**: One sentence that captures the dream outcome
- **Sub-headline**: Addresses the biggest objection
- **Value stack**: Bullet list of everything they get (product + bonuses + guarantee)
- **CTA**: Action-oriented, specific, urgent

### Step 5: Output

Present the complete Grand Slam Offer framework.

### Step 6: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] Value Equation is complete (all 4 components scored and addressed)
- [ ] Offer is differentiated from a generic "buy through my link" promotion
- [ ] Bonuses are specific and deliverable (not vague promises)
- [ ] Guarantee is realistic and scoped to what YOU can deliver
- [ ] Copy is specific to this product (not generic template fill)
- [ ] FTC-compliant — no income claims, no fake urgency

If any check fails, fix before delivering.

**Total value: $XXX — they pay: $XX/mo**

### Ready-to-Use Copy

**Headline:** [headline]
**Sub-headline:** [sub-headline]

**Value Stack:**
[bullet list]

**CTA:** [call to action]

### Next Steps
- Run `bonus-stack-builder` to flesh out bonus details
- Run `guarantee-generator` to craft your guarantee copy
- Run `landing-page-creator` to build the page with this offer
```

## Error Handling

- **No product provided**: "I need a product to design an offer for. Run `affiliate-program-search` first, or tell me the product name."
- **No pricing found**: Use `web_search` for `"[product] pricing"`. If unavailable, use "Check current pricing" and frame value around ROI instead.
- **Product too generic**: "This product competes in a crowded space. Let me find your unique angle..." → focus on YOUR differentiators (bonuses, expertise, guarantee).
- **No competitive data**: Design the offer based on the product alone. Note: "Run `competitor-spy` for competitive intelligence to sharpen this offer."

## Examples

**Example 1:** "Design a grand slam offer for HeyGen"
→ Research HeyGen features/pricing, score Value Equation, identify unique angle (e.g., "AI video for non-creators"), suggest bonuses (script templates, avatar setup guide, prompt library), write offer copy.

**Example 2:** "I promote Semrush but my conversion rate is low"
→ Analyze why: likely weak differentiation. Score Value Equation, identify weakest component (probably Effort — steep learning curve), design bonuses that reduce effort (done-for-you audit template, keyword research spreadsheet, setup walkthrough).

**Example 3:** "Create an offer for this product" (after S1 + purple-cow-audit)
→ Pick up product data from S1, remarkability angles from purple-cow-audit, design offer that amplifies the most remarkable aspects.

## Flywheel Connections

### Feeds Into
- `landing-page-creator` (S4) — offer copy becomes the page's core messaging
- `bonus-stack-builder` (S4) — offer analysis identifies which bonuses to create
- `guarantee-generator` (S4) — value equation reveals what to guarantee
- `email-drip-sequence` (S5) — offer framing drives email copy
- `value-ladder-architect` (S4) — offer positioning informs ladder design

### Fed By
- `affiliate-program-search` (S1) — product data to build the offer around
- `purple-cow-audit` (S1) — remarkability angles to emphasize
- `competitor-spy` (S1) — competitive gaps to exploit in the offer
- `content-moat-calculator` (S3) — authority gaps inform what to emphasize

### Feedback Loop
- Conversion rate from `conversion-tracker` (S6) reveals which Value Equation components resonated → improve weak components on next offer

## Quality Gate

Before delivering output, verify:

1. Would I share this on MY personal social?
2. Contains specific, surprising detail? (not generic)
3. Respects reader's intelligence?
4. Remarkable enough to share? (Purple Cow test)
5. Irresistible offer framing? (Grand Slam formula applied)

Any NO → rewrite before delivering. Do not flag this checklist to the user.

> **Path within category:** `skills/landing/value-ladder-architect/SKILL.md`


# Value Ladder Architect

Design the complete free → tripwire → core → upsell path for affiliate promotions. Maps the entire customer ascension journey, where each step delivers standalone value while naturally leading to the next. The value ladder IS the page sequence: squeeze → bridge → sales → upsell.

## Stage

S4: Landing — The value ladder defines the sequence of pages and offers. Each rung is a landing page, email, or content piece that converts the visitor to the next level.

## When to Use

- User wants to map the entire customer journey, not just one landing page
- User asks about upsells, downsells, tripwires, or funnel stages
- User wants to maximize lifetime value from affiliate promotions
- User says "value ladder", "customer journey", "ascension", "funnel architecture"
- After running `grand-slam-offer` to design the core offer and wanting to expand
- User promotes a product with multiple tiers (free, pro, enterprise)

## Input Schema

```yaml
product:                      # REQUIRED
  name: string                # Product name
  pricing_tiers: object[]     # Available pricing tiers
    - name: string            # e.g., "Free", "Pro", "Enterprise"
      price: string           # e.g., "$0", "$49/mo", "$199/mo"
      features: string[]      # Key features at this tier
  reward_value: string        # Your commission
  reward_type: string         # "recurring" | "one-time" | "tiered"
  url: string                 # Affiliate link

your_assets: string[]         # OPTIONAL — content/resources you already have
                              # e.g., ["blog", "email list", "YouTube channel", "templates"]
                              # Default: ["blog"]

goal: string                  # OPTIONAL — "first_commission" | "maximize_ltv" | "build_list"
                              # Default: "first_commission"
```

**Chaining from S4 grand-slam-offer**: Use `offer_stack` to position the core offer in the ladder.
**Chaining from S4 bonus-stack-builder**: Use `bonus_stack` to populate tripwire and bonus tiers.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context

1. Map the product's pricing tiers and commission structure
2. Identify user's existing assets (blog, list, social following)
3. Determine goal: first commission (simple ladder) vs maximize LTV (complex ladder)

### Step 2: Design the Ladder

Read `shared/references/offer-frameworks.md` for the Value Ladder framework.

Map each rung:

**Rung 0: FREE (Awareness)**
- What: Blog post, social content, free tool, lead magnet
- Goal: Build trust, capture email, demonstrate expertise
- Skills used: S2 Content, S3 Blog
- Conversion to next rung: Lead magnet opt-in or email capture

**Rung 1: TRIPWIRE ($1-$49, impulse buy)**
- What: Your low-cost asset (template pack, mini-course, audit)
- Goal: Convert from reader to buyer, get email if not captured
- Skills used: `bonus-stack-builder` for asset ideas, `squeeze-page-builder` for page
- Conversion to next rung: Email sequence recommending the core product

**Rung 2: CORE (main affiliate product)**
- What: The affiliate product at its most popular tier
- Goal: Primary commission — solve their main problem
- Skills used: `grand-slam-offer`, `landing-page-creator`
- Conversion to next rung: Product usage → ready for premium tier

**Rung 3: UPSELL (premium tier or complementary product)**
- What: Higher tier of same product, or complementary affiliate product
- Goal: Maximize lifetime value, earn larger commission
- Skills used: `landing-page-creator` (comparison), `email-drip-sequence`
- Conversion: Ongoing value through content → repeat customer

### Step 3: Map the Page Sequence

For each rung, specify:
- Page type (blog post, squeeze page, bridge page, landing page, email)
- Traffic source (organic, social, email, paid)
- Affiliate skill to build it
- Conversion mechanism (CTA, email opt-in, checkout)
- Expected conversion rate benchmark

### Step 4: Design Transition Triggers

Define what moves a person from one rung to the next:
- Rung 0→1: Downloaded lead magnet → email sequence pitching tripwire
- Rung 1→2: Purchased tripwire → immediate upsell page OR email sequence
- Rung 2→3: Used product for X days → email about premium features

### Step 5: Output

Present the complete value ladder with implementation roadmap.

### Step 6: Self-Validation

- [ ] Each rung delivers standalone value (P4 principle)
- [ ] Transitions feel natural, not forced
- [ ] The affiliate product is the CORE (Rung 2), not the upsell
- [ ] Free content (Rung 0) is genuinely helpful, not just a teaser
- [ ] Implementation order is realistic (start simple, add rungs over time)
- [ ] FTC disclosure at every rung with affiliate links

## Output Schema

## Output Format

```
## Value Ladder: [Product Name]

### Ladder Overview
```
[Visual ladder diagram using ASCII]
```

### Rung 0: FREE — [Offer Name]
- **What:** [specific content/resource]
- **Where:** [blog post / social / lead magnet]
- **Traffic:** [organic / social / paid]
- **Build with:** [skill name]
- **→ Next:** [transition trigger to Rung 1]
- **Benchmark:** [expected conversion %]

### Rung 1: TRIPWIRE — [Offer Name] ($XX)
[same structure]

### Rung 2: CORE — [Product Name] ($XX/mo)
[same structure]

### Rung 3: UPSELL — [Offer Name] ($XX/mo)
[same structure]

### Implementation Roadmap
1. **Week 1:** Build Rung 2 (core landing page) — start earning immediately
2. **Week 2:** Build Rung 0 (blog content driving traffic)
3. **Week 3:** Build Rung 1 (tripwire to capture emails)
4. **Week 4+:** Build Rung 3 (upsell for max LTV)

### Email Sequences
- **Rung 0→1:** [X emails over Y days] — [theme]
- **Rung 1→2:** [X emails over Y days] — [theme]
- **Rung 2→3:** [X emails over Y days] — [theme]
```

## Error Handling

- **No product provided**: "I need a product to design a value ladder for. Run `affiliate-program-search` or tell me the product."
- **Product has only one pricing tier**: Design ladder with Rung 0 (free content), Rung 1 (your tripwire), Rung 2 (the product). Note complementary products for Rung 3.
- **User has no existing assets**: Start with Rung 2 only (direct landing page). Build Rung 0 and 1 over time. "Start earning first, then build the ladder."
- **Product is one-time payment**: Focus ladder on complementary recurring products for Rung 3 to build ongoing income.

## Examples

**Example 1:** "Design a value ladder for HeyGen"
→ Free: "AI Video for Business" blog series → Tripwire: $7 "50 AI Video Script Templates" → Core: HeyGen Pro ($48/mo, 30% recurring) → Upsell: HeyGen Enterprise + your premium implementation package.

**Example 2:** "I have a blog and email list, design my Semrush funnel"
→ Free: SEO tutorial blog posts → Tripwire: $19 "Complete SEO Audit Template Kit" → Core: Semrush Pro ($129/mo, $200 bounty) → Upsell: Semrush Business + monthly SEO coaching.

**Example 3:** "Map my funnel" (after grand-slam-offer + bonus-stack)
→ Pick up offer and bonuses from chain context. Place bonuses as tripwire (Rung 1), core offer as Rung 2, design complementary upsell for Rung 3.

### Feedback Loop
- `conversion-tracker` (S6) measures conversion rates between rungs → identify bottleneck rungs and optimize

## Quality Gate

Before delivering output, verify:

1. Would I share this on MY personal social?
2. Contains specific, surprising detail? (not generic)
3. Respects reader's intelligence?
4. Remarkable enough to share? (Purple Cow test)
5. Irresistible offer framing? (each rung feels like a natural step)

Any NO → rewrite before delivering.

## 15. Expert Skill: guarantee-generator
> **Path within category:** `skills/landing/guarantee-generator/SKILL.md`


# Guarantee Generator

Create YOUR personal guarantee that sits on top of the product's built-in guarantee. Addresses the gap: "What if I buy through your link and it doesn't work for me?" Risk reversal is the most underleveraged conversion tool in affiliate marketing.

## Stage

S4: Landing — Guarantees are landing page copy. They directly impact conversion by removing the last barrier to clicking your affiliate link.

## When to Use

- User wants to increase conversion by reducing buyer perceived risk
- User asks "what guarantee can I offer as an affiliate?"
- User says "guarantee", "risk reversal", "risk-free", "money back"
- After running `grand-slam-offer` or `bonus-stack-builder` to complete the offer
- User has low conversion rates and needs to address trust/risk objections

## Input Schema

```yaml
product:                    # REQUIRED
  name: string              # Product name
  pricing: string           # Product price
  has_free_trial: boolean   # Does the product offer a free trial?
  has_guarantee: string     # Product's existing guarantee (e.g., "30-day money back")

your_bonuses: string[]      # OPTIONAL — bonuses from bonus-stack-builder
                            # Default: none

your_capacity: string       # OPTIONAL — "low" | "medium" | "high"
                            # How much personal time you can invest
                            # Default: "medium"

audience_fears: string[]    # OPTIONAL — top objections/fears
                            # Default: inferred from product type
```

**Chaining from S4 bonus-stack-builder**: Use `bonus_stack.bonuses` to reference specific bonuses in guarantee.

**Chaining from S4 grand-slam-offer**: Use `value_equation` to target the weakest component with the guarantee.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context

1. Understand the product's existing guarantee/refund policy
2. Identify top 3 buyer fears for this product category
3. Assess user's capacity to deliver on guarantee promises

### Step 2: Design Guarantee Options

Read `shared/references/offer-frameworks.md` for guarantee types.

Create 3 guarantee options at different commitment levels:

**Option A: Light Touch** (low capacity)
- Scope: Your bonuses only
- Example: "If my bonuses don't help you get started faster, I'll refund their value"
- Risk to you: Minimal

**Option B: Support Guarantee** (medium capacity)
- Scope: Your time + bonuses
- Example: "If you're stuck after 30 days, I'll personally help you implement for 1 hour"
- Risk to you: Moderate (capped time)

**Option C: Results Guarantee** (high capacity)
- Scope: Specific outcome
- Example: "If you don't [specific measurable result] in [timeframe], I'll [specific action]"
- Risk to you: Higher (but highest conversion impact)

### Step 3: Write Guarantee Copy

For each option, produce:
1. **Guarantee headline** — bold, specific, confident
2. **Guarantee body** — exactly what you promise, the conditions, and the timeframe
3. **Claim process** — how they reach you if they want to use the guarantee
4. **Fine print** — fair conditions (must actually use the product, specific timeframe)

### Step 4: Recommend Best Fit

Based on `your_capacity` and product type, recommend one guarantee with reasoning.

### Step 5: Self-Validation

- [ ] Guarantee is specific (not vague "satisfaction guaranteed")
- [ ] Guarantee is scoped to what YOU can deliver (not the product's features)
- [ ] Guarantee has a clear timeframe
- [ ] Claim process is simple and accessible
- [ ] Guarantee is realistic — you can actually fulfill it
- [ ] No guarantees about income or specific financial results (FTC)

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"
guarantee:
  product_name: string
  recommended_option: string     # "A" | "B" | "C"
  options:
    - level: string              # "light" | "support" | "results"
      headline: string
      body: string
      claim_process: string
      timeframe: string
      risk_to_you: string        # "minimal" | "moderate" | "higher"
      conversion_impact: string  # "moderate" | "high" | "very high"

chain_metadata:
  skill_slug: "guarantee-generator"
  stage: "landing"
  timestamp: string
  suggested_next:
    - "landing-page-creator"
    - "email-drip-sequence"
```

## Output Format

```
## Your Guarantee: [Product Name]

### Product's Existing Guarantee
[What the product already offers]

### YOUR Guarantee Options

#### Option A: Light Touch ⚡
**"[Guarantee headline]"**
[Body copy]
- Timeframe: [X days]
- Claim: [how to claim]
- Risk to you: Minimal

#### Option B: Support Guarantee 🤝
**"[Guarantee headline]"**
[Body copy]
- Timeframe: [X days]
- Claim: [how to claim]
- Risk to you: Moderate

#### Option C: Results Guarantee 🎯
**"[Guarantee headline]"**
[Body copy]
- Timeframe: [X days]
- Claim: [how to claim]
- Risk to you: Higher

### Recommended: Option [X]
[Why this option fits your situation]

### Ready-to-Use Copy
[Complete guarantee section copy, ready to paste into landing page]
```

## Error Handling

- **No product provided**: "I need a product to create a guarantee for. Tell me the product or run `affiliate-program-search` first."
- **User uncomfortable with guarantees**: Emphasize Option A — low risk, still impactful. "Even a light guarantee outperforms no guarantee."
- **Product has no refund policy**: Note this as a risk factor. Design guarantee around YOUR bonuses only (Option A).
- **User wants to guarantee income/results**: Flag FTC risk. Reframe to process guarantees: "I guarantee I'll help you implement" not "I guarantee you'll make $X".

## Examples

**Example 1:** "Create a guarantee for my HeyGen promotion"
→ Research HeyGen's refund policy, identify fears (is AI video quality good enough? will I look stupid?), create 3 options ranging from "bonus refund" to "I'll personally record your first video with you."

**Example 2:** "I don't have much time but want to offer a guarantee for Semrush"
→ your_capacity=low → Recommend Option A: "If my SEO audit template doesn't save you 3+ hours, email me and I'll personally audit one page for you." Low time commitment, high perceived value.

**Example 3:** "Design a results guarantee" (after grand-slam-offer + bonus-stack)
→ Use value equation weakness (e.g., time delay) as guarantee target: "If you haven't created your first campaign within 48 hours using my setup guide, I'll do it for you on a screenshare."

## Revenue & Action Plan

### Expected Outcomes
- **Revenue potential**: Adding a personal guarantee increases conversion rates by 15-30%. If your landing page converts at 2% with 1,000 monthly visitors = 20 sales × $50 = $1,000/month. With a guarantee at 2.5% = 25 sales = $1,250/month — an extra $250/month for 30 minutes of work
- **Benchmark**: Results guarantees (Option C) show the highest conversion lift (25-30%) but carry more risk. Support guarantees (Option B) offer the best risk-reward balance (15-20% lift, capped time commitment)
- **Key metric to track**: Conversion rate before vs after adding the guarantee. Also track guarantee claim rate — if <5% of buyers claim the guarantee, you're safe to offer bolder guarantees

### Do This Right Now (15 min)
1. Pick the **Recommended option** from the output
2. Copy the "Ready-to-Use Copy" section and paste it directly into your landing page
3. Add your contact email/DM as the claim channel
4. If you don't have a landing page yet, run `landing-page-creator` with the guarantee section included

### Track Your Results
After 30 days: did conversion rate increase? How many people claimed the guarantee? If zero claims after 50+ sales, consider upgrading to a bolder guarantee (more conversion lift, same low risk).

> **Next step — copy-paste this prompt:**
> "Create a landing page for [product] with this guarantee and my bonus stack" → runs `landing-page-creator`

## 16. Expert Skill: squeeze-page-builder
> **Path within category:** `skills/landing/squeeze-page-builder/SKILL.md`


# Squeeze Page Builder

Build email capture landing pages (squeeze pages) as self-contained HTML files with no dependencies. The page offers a high-value lead magnet (ebook, checklist, template, or cheat sheet) in exchange for the visitor's email address, then redirects to an affiliate offer on form submission. Output is a single deployable `.html` file.

## When to Use

- User wants to build an email list while simultaneously promoting an affiliate product
- User wants to warm up cold traffic before sending to an affiliate offer
- User says "squeeze page", "opt-in page", "lead magnet", "email capture", "freebie page"
- User wants a two-step funnel: email capture → affiliate redirect
- User has ad traffic and needs a landing page that collects leads before the affiliate click

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define the Lead Magnet and Offer

A squeeze page requires two things:
1. **The lead magnet** — the free thing offered in exchange for the email
2. **The thank-you redirect** — where the visitor goes after submitting (the affiliate link)

**Detect from user input. If not specified, ask:**
- "What free resource will you offer? (e.g., a checklist, ebook, template, cheat sheet, mini-course)"
- "What affiliate product should visitors see after they sign up?"

**Lead magnet selection guide** — suggest based on niche if user is unsure:
| Niche | Best lead magnet type |
|---|---|
| Marketing / SEO | Checklist, swipe file, templates |
| Finance / Investing | Calculator, cheat sheet, guide |
| Health / Fitness | Meal plan, workout plan, tracker |
| Software / SaaS | Tutorial, quick-start guide, resource list |
| Business / Productivity | Templates, SOPs, spreadsheets |

**Lead magnet title formula** (high-converting):
- "[N]-Point Checklist: How to [Achieve Desired Outcome]"
- "The Free [Niche] Starter Kit: [X] Templates for [Goal]"
- "Download: The Ultimate [Topic] Guide ([Year])"
- "[Adjective] Cheat Sheet: [X] Ways to [Outcome] in [Timeframe]"

### Step 2: Craft the Page Strategy

Read `references/conversion-principles.md` for squeeze page-specific principles.

Key conversion levers for squeeze pages:
1. **Clarity over cleverness** — the visitor should know in 3 seconds what they get and what they must do
2. **Above-fold completeness** — the opt-in form must be visible without scrolling on mobile
3. **Single goal** — no navigation, no external links, no distractions
4. **Social proof** — even one strong number ("Join 4,200+ marketers") dramatically lifts conversion
5. **Privacy signal** — "No spam. Unsubscribe anytime." reduces friction at the form

Plan the page sections:
1. **Header** — logo/brand name only (no nav links)
2. **Hero section** (above fold):
   - Headline: the transformation or outcome the lead magnet delivers
   - Sub-headline: what's inside + who it's for
   - Lead magnet visual (styled HTML mockup — no images needed)
   - Email form with single field + submit button
   - Privacy micro-copy: "No spam. Unsubscribe anytime."
3. **What's Inside** — 3-5 bullet points describing lead magnet contents
4. **Social Proof** — subscriber count, testimonial, or press mention
5. **Who This Is For** — 3-4 bullet points identifying the ideal reader
6. **Second opt-in form** — repeat the form lower on the page for scrollers
7. **Footer** — FTC note, privacy policy placeholder, Affitor attribution

**Thank-you redirect behavior:**
The form submission should redirect to the affiliate URL. Since this is a static HTML file with no backend, use a JavaScript pattern:
```javascript
form.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  // In production: POST email to your ESP (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, etc.)
  // Then redirect to affiliate offer:
  window.location.href = '[affiliate_url]';
});
```
Include a comment block explaining how to wire this to a real ESP (Mailchimp embed code, ConvertKit, etc.).

### Step 3: Write the Full HTML

Build a complete, self-contained HTML file:

**Copy requirements:**

Headline (8-12 words, result-focused):
- "Get the Free [Lead Magnet Title] and Start [Outcome] Today"
- "Download: [Lead Magnet Title] — Free for [Audience]"
- "The [Adjective] Way to [Outcome]: Free [Format] Inside"

Sub-headline (15-25 words):
- "[N] [templates/steps/strategies] that [specific audience] use to [specific outcome] — completely free."

Button copy (action-oriented, not "Submit"):
- "Send Me the Free [Lead Magnet] →"
- "Get Instant Access →"
- "Download the Free [Format] Now →"

**HTML structure requirements:**
- Single `<style>` block — no external CSS
- Mobile-first responsive (375px base, 768px breakpoint)
- System font stack: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif`
- Color scheme from user input or default: primary `#2563eb`, accent warm tone
- Lead magnet mockup: a styled `<div>` that looks like a book/checklist cover — pure CSS, no images
- Form: single email input + submit button (no name field — lower friction)
- No navigation links that could take the visitor off the page
- `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` — squeeze pages shouldn't be indexed by Google

**JavaScript:**
- Form validation (email format check)
- Redirect to affiliate URL on submit
- Comment block with ESP integration instructions for Mailchimp, ConvertKit, Kit, and Beehiiv

**Required elements:**
- FTC disclosure in footer: "This page contains affiliate links. If you purchase through our links, we may earn a commission."
- Privacy micro-copy on form: "No spam. Unsubscribe anytime."
- "Built with Affiliate Skills by Affitor" footer — use exact HTML from `shared/references/affitor-branding.md`

### Step 4: Format Output

**Part 1: Page Summary**
```
Lead Magnet: [title of the free offer]
Affiliate Redirect: [product name] — [affiliate URL]
Headline: [the main headline used]
Button Copy: [CTA button text]
Color Scheme: [color applied]
ESP Integration: Instructions included in HTML comments
SETUP
```

## Input Schema

```yaml
lead_magnet:                # REQUIRED
  title: string             # e.g., "The 10-Point SEO Audit Checklist"
  type: string              # "checklist" | "ebook" | "template" | "cheat-sheet" | "mini-course" | "resource-list"
  description: string       # What's inside — used for bullet points

affiliate_product:          # REQUIRED — where to redirect after email capture
  name: string
  url: string               # Affiliate link — the thank-you redirect destination
  reward_value: string
  description: string       # Brief — used in footer context if needed

target_audience: string     # REQUIRED — who this page is for (e.g., "e-commerce store owners")

niche: string               # OPTIONAL — helps with copy tone and lead magnet visual styling
                            # e.g., "marketing", "finance", "fitness", "SaaS"

headline: string            # OPTIONAL — override auto-generated headline

color_scheme: string        # OPTIONAL — "blue" | "green" | "purple" | "orange" | "dark" | hex
                            # Default: "blue" (#2563eb)

social_proof: object        # OPTIONAL — subscriber count or testimonial
  type: string              # "count" | "testimonial"
  value: string             # "4,200+ subscribers" OR a short quote
  attribution: string       # If testimonial: "— Name, Job Title"

esp: string                 # OPTIONAL — which email service provider they use
                            # "mailchimp" | "convertkit" | "beehiiv" | "aweber" | "other"
                            # Default: "other" (generic instructions)
```

### Step 5: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] FTC disclosure in footer
- [ ] Privacy micro-copy near form: "No spam. Unsubscribe anytime."
- [ ] `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` present
- [ ] Form has single email field only (no name field — lower friction)
- [ ] Form validates email format before submission
- [ ] Self-contained HTML: no external resources, no navigation links off-page

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
squeeze_page:
  lead_magnet_title: string
  headline: string
  button_copy: string
  affiliate_redirect: string    # The affiliate URL used in the redirect
  color_scheme: string
  html: string                  # Complete self-contained HTML
  filename: string              # e.g., "seo-checklist-optin.html"

funnel:
  step_1: string               # "Visitor sees squeeze page"
  step_2: string               # "Visitor submits email"
  step_3: string               # "Visitor redirected to [product] affiliate page"
  esp_note: string             # Note about wiring to an ESP

deploy:
  local: string
  netlify: string
  github_pages: string
```

## Output Format

Present as three sections:
1. **Page Summary** — lead magnet, redirect target, headline used
2. **HTML** — complete file in a code block, ready to save and deploy
3. **Setup Instructions** — how to wire ESP and deploy

The HTML should work as a preview without any backend — form submission redirects to affiliate URL directly in the demo state.

## Error Handling

- **No lead magnet specified**: Suggest 3 options based on the niche. Ask: "Which type of lead magnet would you like? Here are 3 ideas for [niche]: [A], [B], [C]."
- **No affiliate URL**: "What affiliate product should visitors see after they sign up? This is the thank-you redirect destination."
- **Audience too vague**: Use the niche to infer audience. If still unclear, use "online entrepreneurs and marketers" as the default.
- **No ESP specified**: Include generic ESP instructions in comments covering Mailchimp, ConvertKit, and Beehiiv.
- **User wants form to actually send emails**: Explain that static HTML cannot send emails directly. Provide instructions for using Netlify Forms or Formspree as a free no-backend option.

## Examples

**Example 1: SEO checklist**
User: "Build a squeeze page offering a free SEO checklist, send people to my Semrush affiliate link after"
Action: lead_magnet={title:"10-Point SEO Audit Checklist", type:"checklist"}, affiliate_redirect=Semrush URL, generate page with checklist mockup visual, blue theme.

**Example 2: Custom headline and color**
User: "Create an email capture page for a free email marketing template pack, purple color scheme, redirect to Klaviyo"
Action: lead_magnet="Email Marketing Template Pack", color_scheme=purple, affiliate_redirect=Klaviyo, generate page.

**Example 3: With social proof**
User: "Squeeze page for a free AI tools cheat sheet with 2000 subscribers social proof"
Action: lead_magnet="AI Tools Cheat Sheet", social_proof={type:"count", value:"2,000+ subscribers"}, generate page with subscriber count displayed prominently.

**Example 4: Chained from S1**
User: "Build a squeeze page to warm up leads before sending them to this offer"
Context: S1 returned HeyGen as recommended_program
Action: affiliate_product=HeyGen from S1, suggest 3 lead magnet ideas for the AI video niche, build squeeze page on selection.

## 17. Expert Skill: bonus-stack-builder
> **Path within category:** `skills/landing/bonus-stack-builder/SKILL.md`


# Bonus Stack Builder

Design exclusive bonus packages that make YOUR affiliate link the only rational choice. The product is the same through every affiliate's link — your bonuses are what differentiate you. Creates specific, deliverable bonuses matched to your skills and audience needs.

## Stage

S4: Landing — Bonuses live on the landing page. They are the conversion differentiator between your link and every other affiliate promoting the same product.

## When to Use

- User promotes an affiliate product and wants to stand out from other affiliates
- User asks "why would someone buy through MY link?"
- User wants to increase conversion rates on existing promotions
- User says "bonus", "bonus stack", "exclusive offer", "differentiate"
- After running `grand-slam-offer` to flesh out the bonus suggestions

## Input Schema

```yaml

**Chaining from S4 grand-slam-offer**: If `grand-slam-offer` was run, use `offer_stack.bonuses` as starting point and flesh them out.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context

1. If product data available from chain, use directly. Otherwise `web_search` for product details.
2. Identify the product's top 3 pain points it solves
3. Identify the product's top 3 gaps (things users struggle with after buying)
4. Research: `"[product] complaints" OR "[product] struggles" OR "[product] learning curve"` to find bonus opportunities

### Step 2: Design Bonus Stack

Read `shared/references/offer-frameworks.md` for bonus types and rules.

For each bonus, define:
1. **What it is** — specific deliverable, not vague
2. **What problem it solves** — maps to a pain point or product gap
3. **Format** — PDF, video, template, spreadsheet, community access, call
4. **Perceived value** — what you'd charge if sold separately
5. **Effort to create** — low/medium/high (helps user prioritize)
6. **Exclusivity** — why this is ONLY available through your link

Design 5-7 bonuses across these tiers:
- **Tier 1: Quick wins** (low effort to create, high perceived value) — templates, checklists, swipe files
- **Tier 2: Deep value** (medium effort, high impact) — mini-course, workshop recording, tool
- **Tier 3: Premium** (high effort, ultimate differentiator) — personal support, community, coaching

### Step 3: Calculate Stack Value

- Sum perceived values of all bonuses
- Compare to product price — bonus value should be 3-10x product price
- Identify the "hero bonus" — the one that does the most persuasive heavy lifting

### Step 4: Write Bonus Copy

For each bonus, write:
- **Name** — specific and benefit-driven (not "Bonus #1")
- **One-liner** — what it is + what it does for them
- **Value statement** — "$XX value — FREE with your purchase"
- **Delivery method** — how they get it after purchasing

### Step 5: Self-Validation

- [ ] Each bonus is specific and deliverable (not vague promises)
- [ ] At least one bonus addresses the product's biggest gap
- [ ] Total bonus value exceeds product price
- [ ] At least one "exclusive" bonus (only through your link)
- [ ] All bonuses are within your skills to actually create
- [ ] No income claims or unrealistic promises

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"
bonus_stack:
  product_name: string
  total_value: string          # Total perceived value of all bonuses
  product_price: string        # For comparison
  hero_bonus: string           # The most compelling bonus name

  stage: "landing"
  timestamp: string
  suggested_next:
    - "landing-page-creator"
    - "guarantee-generator"
    - "email-drip-sequence"
```

## Output Format

```
## Bonus Stack: [Product Name]

### Stack Overview
- **Product price:** $XX/mo
- **Total bonus value:** $XXX
- **Hero bonus:** [name]
- **Message:** "Get $XXX in exclusive bonuses FREE when you start [product] through my link"

### Bonus 1: [Name] ($XX value)
**What:** [specific deliverable]
**Solves:** [pain point]
**Format:** [format]
**Delivery:** [how they get it]
**Why exclusive:** [only through your link because...]

[Repeat for each bonus]

### Bonus Copy (ready to paste)

✅ [Bonus 1 name] — [one-liner] ($XX value)
✅ [Bonus 2 name] — [one-liner] ($XX value)
...
**Total value: $XXX — yours FREE through my link**

### Creation Priority
1. [Easiest bonus to create first — get live fast]
2. [Next priority]
3. [Can create later — still mention on page]
```

## Error Handling

- **No product provided**: "I need a product to design bonuses for. Run `affiliate-program-search` first, or tell me the product."
- **No skills specified**: Suggest universal bonuses anyone can create: curated resource lists, setup checklists, comparison spreadsheets, email templates.
- **Product is free tier**: Focus bonuses on accelerating results (templates, guides) rather than adding financial value.
- **User can't deliver high-effort bonuses**: Prioritize Tier 1 (templates, checklists) — they have high perceived value with low creation effort.

## Examples

**Example 1:** "Design bonuses for HeyGen affiliate link"
→ Research HeyGen pain points (avatar creation, script writing, video editing), design bonuses: AI avatar setup guide, 50 video script templates, brand voice cheatsheet, private community access, 1-on-1 setup call.

**Example 2:** "What bonuses can I offer for Semrush? I'm a content writer."
→ Match writer skills to Semrush gaps: keyword research template, content calendar spreadsheet, SEO audit checklist, writing prompts for each content type, monthly strategy call.

**Example 3:** "Create bonuses for this product" (after grand-slam-offer)
→ Take bonus suggestions from grand-slam-offer output, flesh each out with specific deliverables, formats, perceived values, and creation timeline.

## Revenue & Action Plan

### Expected Outcomes
- **Revenue potential**: Bonus stacks increase affiliate conversion rates by 2-5x. If your current conversion rate is 1% with 500 monthly clicks = 5 sales × $50 commission = $250/month. With a bonus stack at 3% conversion = 15 sales = $750/month — a $500/month increase from the SAME traffic
- **Benchmark**: Affiliates with bonus stacks report 200-400% higher conversion rates vs naked affiliate links. The hero bonus alone can double conversions
- **Key metric to track**: Conversion rate (sales / clicks) with vs without bonus stack. A/B test by running traffic to both versions for 2 weeks

### Do This Right Now (15 min)
1. Create the **easiest Tier 1 bonus first** — a checklist, template, or swipe file takes 15-30 minutes to make
2. Add the bonus stack copy to your landing page (or create one with `landing-page-creator`)
3. Don't wait until ALL bonuses are ready — launch with 2-3 and add more over time
4. Send an email to your list announcing the exclusive bonuses

### Track Your Results
After 2 weeks: compare conversion rates with and without the bonus stack. If conversion didn't improve, your bonuses don't match the audience's actual pain points — redesign around different pain points.

> **Next step — copy-paste this prompt:**
> "Create a landing page for [product] featuring these bonuses: [list bonuses]" → runs `landing-page-creator`

## Flywheel Connections

### Feeds Into
- `landing-page-creator` (S4) — bonus details populate the bonus section of landing pages
- `guarantee-generator` (S4) — bonus stack informs what to guarantee
- `email-drip-sequence` (S5) — bonus details drive email content
- `squeeze-page-builder` (S4) — bonuses can be the lead magnet

### Fed By
- `grand-slam-offer` (S4) — initial bonus suggestions to flesh out
- `affiliate-program-search` (S1) — product data
- `competitor-spy` (S1) — what competitors' affiliates offer (gaps to exploit)

### Feedback Loop
- `conversion-tracker` (S6) reports which bonus mentions get the most clicks → emphasize those bonuses, redesign underperformers

## Quality Gate

Before delivering output, verify:

1. Would I share this on MY personal social?
2. Contains specific, surprising detail? (not generic)
3. Respects reader's intelligence?
4. Remarkable enough to share? (Purple Cow test)
5. Irresistible offer framing? (bonuses feel genuinely valuable)

Any NO → rewrite before delivering.

## 18. Expert Skill: product-showcase-page
> **Path within category:** `skills/landing/product-showcase-page/SKILL.md`


# Product Showcase Page

Build a long-form, single-product showcase page as a self-contained HTML file. Goes deeper than a standard landing page — includes a full hero section, feature breakdown with icons, use case demonstrations, testimonials, a pricing comparison table, FAQ with accordions, and multiple high-intent affiliate CTAs. Designed for pre-sold traffic (readers who came from a review or comparison) and wants to make the final conversion push.

## When to Use

- User wants a dedicated page for one product that covers everything a buyer needs to know
- User says "showcase page", "product spotlight", "deep-dive page", "feature breakdown page"
- User wants a page longer than a standard landing page — for high-ticket products needing more persuasion
- User is sending warm traffic (from a blog post or email) and wants to close the sale
- User wants a page that can double as a product review in page form

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Product Data

If `product` data is available from S1 or prior conversation, use it directly.

Otherwise, use `web_search` to research the product:
1. **Features**: `"[product name] features"` — gather 6-12 distinct capabilities
2. **Pricing**: `"[product name] pricing"` — all tiers with feature differences
3. **Use cases**: `"[product name] use cases"` OR `"[product name] examples"` — concrete applications
4. **Testimonials**: `"[product name] reviews"` on G2/Capterra — find real sentiment (do not copy verbatim — paraphrase or create realistic representative examples)
5. **Competitors**: `"[product name] vs"` — 2-3 competitors for the pricing comparison
6. **FAQ**: `"[product name] questions"` OR check product's own FAQ page

Organize the research into these buckets:
- Core features (6-12, each with a one-sentence benefit statement)
- Use cases (3-5, each framed as a specific problem solved)
- Pricing tiers (2-4 tiers with included features and price)
- Comparison data (the 5-8 dimensions where this product wins vs. competitors)
- Social proof (ratings, user counts, company names using it)
- FAQ answers (6-10 questions)

### Step 2: Plan the Page Architecture

Read `references/conversion-principles.md` for long-form page principles.

A product showcase page is longer than a standard landing page — it must justify the length with value at every section. Plan each section:

1. **FTC Disclosure** — small, above hero
2. **Hero** — headline + sub-headline + primary CTA + hero visual + trust bar
3. **Problem Statement** — 2-3 sentences establishing the pain the product solves
4. **Product Overview** — 3-sentence description + key stats
5. **Features Grid** — 6-12 features with icons (pure CSS) + headline + description
6. **Use Cases** — 3-5 real scenarios (who uses it, how, outcome)
7. **Social Proof Bar** — logos, ratings, subscriber counts
8. **Pricing Comparison** — table comparing this product's tiers against 2 competitors
9. **Testimonials** — 2-3 cards with quote, name, role
10. **FAQ Accordion** — 6-10 questions with JS-powered expand/collapse
11. **Final CTA Section** — strong headline + benefits recap + primary CTA button
12. **Footer** — FTC disclosure full text, Affitor attribution

**CTA placement rules:**
- Hero: primary CTA (always visible)
- After Features Grid: secondary CTA
- After Pricing Table: high-intent CTA (primed by seeing pricing)
- After Testimonials: social-proof-backed CTA
- Final CTA section: closing CTA
- Total: 4-5 CTAs per page

**Angle selection** — choose based on what the research shows:
| Angle | Headline formula |
|---|---|
| Best in category | "The [Category] Tool That Actually Works" |
| Price/value | "Get [Competitor]-Level Results for Half the Price" |
| Speed | "From Zero to [Outcome] in [Timeframe]" |
| Simplicity | "The [Category] Tool That Doesn't Require a Manual" |
| Results-focused | "[Specific Outcome]: How [Product] Delivers Where Others Don't" |

### Step 3: Write the Full HTML

Build a complete self-contained HTML file. This page is longer than standard (~150-200 lines of HTML) and should feel like a high-quality product page.

**Design specifications:**
- All CSS inline in a `<style>` block — no external stylesheets
- System font stack — no Google Fonts
- Mobile-first responsive (375px base, 768px, 1024px breakpoints)
- Feature icons: pure CSS geometric shapes or Unicode symbols — no icon libraries
- FAQ accordion: minimal JavaScript for expand/collapse, gracefully degrades without JS
- Color scheme from input or default blue (`#2563eb`) with appropriate complementary tones
- Section alternating backgrounds for visual rhythm (white / light gray / white)

**Copy requirements per section:**

*Hero Headline* (6-12 words, outcome-focused):
- Avoid: "Welcome to [Product]", "[Product] is the best...", generic superlatives
- Use: specific outcomes, target audience callouts, contrarian angles

*Feature headlines* (each feature gets a benefit headline, not a feature name):
- Not: "Advanced Reporting Dashboard"
- Yes: "See Exactly What's Working at a Glance"

*Use case structure* (one per scenario):
```html
<!-- The problem → The solution → The result pattern -->
"[Job title] needed to [task]. With [Product]'s [feature], they [outcome] in [timeframe]."
```

*Pricing table* (comparison layout):
- Column 1: this product (highlighted as "Recommended")
- Column 2: Competitor A
- Column 3: Competitor B
- Rows: 8-10 comparison features
- Include: "Free trial" row and "Cancel anytime" signal

*Testimonials* (2-3 cards):
Write realistic representative testimonials if real ones unavailable. Each must have:
- A specific, measurable result ("Saved 6 hours a week", "ROI of 340%")
- Name + job title + company type
- Do NOT use made-up full names and companies — use "[First name], [Job title] at a [company type]" format

*FAQ items* (6-10):
Cover the real objections:
- Pricing and cancellation questions
- Technical requirements
- Data security / privacy
- How it compares to [main competitor]
- Onboarding time
- Customer support availability

**Required elements:**
- FTC disclosure (small, above hero)
- All affiliate links with `target="_blank" rel="noopener"`
- `<meta name="viewport">` and basic SEO meta tags
- `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` (product pages are not for organic search)
- "Built with Affiliate Skills by Affitor" footer from `shared/references/affitor-branding.md`

### Step 4: Format Output

**Part 1: Page Summary**
```
Product: [name]
Angle: [marketing angle used]
Headline: [hero headline]
Sections: [list all sections in order]
CTAs: [count and placement]
Color: [color scheme]
Features covered: [N]
FAQ items: [N]
DEPLOY
```

## Input Schema

```yaml
product:                    # REQUIRED
  name: string
  description: string
  reward_value: string
  url: string               # Affiliate link
  reward_type: string
  cookie_days: number
  tags: string[]

angle: string               # OPTIONAL — marketing angle
                            # "best-in-class" | "price-value" | "speed" | "simplicity" | "results"
                            # Default: auto-detected from product strengths

compare_with: object[]      # OPTIONAL — competitors for pricing comparison table
  - name: string
    pricing: string         # Starting price
    url: string             # Non-affiliate URL

color_scheme: string        # OPTIONAL — "blue" | "green" | "purple" | "orange" | "dark" | hex
                            # Default: "blue"

target_audience: string     # OPTIONAL — specific audience to call out in hero
                            # e.g., "e-commerce store owners", "freelance designers"

social_proof: object        # OPTIONAL — headline social proof signal
  type: string              # "rating" | "user_count" | "company_logos" | "award"
  value: string             # e.g., "4.8/5 on G2", "50,000+ users", "Used by Fortune 500s"

testimonials: object[]      # OPTIONAL — real testimonials to include
  - quote: string
    name: string
    role: string
    result: string          # The specific result they achieved
```

### Step 5: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] FTC disclosure present (small format, above hero)
- [ ] `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` present
- [ ] ≥4 CTAs at: hero, after features, after pricing, after testimonials, final section
- [ ] All affiliate links have `target="_blank" rel="noopener"`
- [ ] Self-contained HTML: icons are CSS/Unicode only, no external resources
- [ ] "Built with Affiliate Skills by Affitor" footer present

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
showcase_page:
  product_name: string
  angle: string
  headline: string
  color_scheme: string
  html: string
  filename: string          # e.g., "heygen-showcase.html"
  section_count: number
  cta_count: number
  faq_count: number

products_featured:
  - name: string
    url: string
    role: string            # "primary" | "compared"
    cta_count: number

deploy:
  local: string
  netlify: string
  vercel: string
```

## Output Format

Present as three sections:
1. **Page Summary** — product, angle, structure overview, CTA placements
2. **HTML** — complete file in a code block
3. **Deploy Instructions** — preview, customize, deploy steps

The page should be immediately useful as a high-converting standalone URL.

## Error Handling

- **No product provided**: "I need a product to build this showcase for. Run `/affiliate-program-search` first, or tell me the product name and I'll research it."
- **No competitor data for pricing table**: Use `web_search` to find 1-2 competitors. If still unavailable: replace comparison table with single-product pricing tiers table.
- **High-ticket product (>$500/mo)**: Emphasize ROI framing over price framing. Add "Request a Demo" or "Book a Call" CTA alongside the direct sign-up CTA.
- **Product has free plan**: Feature the free plan prominently — it's the main objection handler. Make "Start free, upgrade when ready" a core CTA pattern.
- **Product is B2B enterprise** (no public pricing): Replace pricing table with feature comparison. Use "Get a quote" or "Contact sales" CTA. Note in output.

## Examples

**Example 1: Standard SaaS showcase**
User: "Build a product showcase page for HeyGen"
Action: web_search HeyGen features/pricing/reviews, angle=results-focused ("Create Studio-Quality Videos in Minutes"), blue theme, write full showcase with 12 features, 4 use cases, 3 tiers, 3 testimonials, 8-item FAQ.

**Example 2: With custom angle**
User: "Showcase page for Semrush with a price-value angle vs Ahrefs"
Action: product=Semrush, angle=price-value, compare_with=[Ahrefs, Moz], build pricing comparison table with Semrush as the highlighted winner column.

**Example 3: Dark theme for tech audience**
User: "Product showcase for GitHub Copilot, dark theme, developer audience"
Action: product=GitHub Copilot, color_scheme=dark, target_audience="software developers", feature copy written in technical voice, code snippet examples in use cases section.

**Example 4: Chained from S1**
User: "Create a deep-dive showcase page for this product"
Context: S1 returned Klaviyo as recommended_program
Action: Auto-pick up Klaviyo from S1 output, research features, build full showcase page.

## 19. Expert Skill: landing-page-creator
> **Path within category:** `skills/landing/landing-page-creator/SKILL.md`


# Landing Page Creator

Build dedicated affiliate landing pages that convert. Output is a single self-contained HTML file with inline CSS — no build step, no dependencies, mobile-responsive, deployable anywhere. Supports two page types: single product spotlight and multi-product comparison.

## Stage

S4: Landing — Higher conversion than blog links because the entire page is designed around one goal: convert a visitor into a click. Landing pages are the bridge between traffic sources (social, email, ads) and the affiliate product.

## When to Use

- User wants a dedicated page to promote an affiliate product
- User wants a comparison/vs page for 2-3 competing products
- User has a product from S1 (affiliate-program-search) and needs a conversion page
- User says anything like "landing page", "sales page", "product page", "comparison page", "vs page"
- User wants to promote an affiliate product beyond blog content
- User needs a deployable HTML page for an affiliate campaign

## Input Schema

```yaml
product:                    # REQUIRED — the affiliate product to feature
  name: string              # Product name (e.g., "HeyGen")
  description: string       # What it does
  reward_value: string      # Commission (e.g., "30% recurring")
  url: string               # Affiliate link URL
  reward_type: string       # "recurring" | "one-time" | "tiered"
  cookie_days: number       # Cookie duration
  tags: string[]            # e.g., ["ai", "video", "saas"]

page_type: string           # OPTIONAL — "single" | "comparison"
                            # Default: "single"

compare_with: object[]      # OPTIONAL — products for comparison page
  - name: string            # Competitor name
    description: string     # Brief description
    url: string             # URL (non-affiliate OK)
    pricing: string         # Starting price

angle: string               # OPTIONAL — marketing angle / hook
                            # e.g., "fastest", "cheapest", "best for beginners"
                            # Default: auto-generated from product strengths

color_scheme: string        # OPTIONAL — "blue" | "green" | "purple" | "orange" | "dark" | hex code
                            # Default: "blue" (#2563eb)
```

**Chaining from S1**: If `affiliate-program-search` was run earlier in the conversation, automatically pick up `recommended_program` from its output as the `product` input. The field mapping:
- `recommended_program.name` → `product.name`
- `recommended_program.description` → `product.description`
- `recommended_program.reward_value` → `product.reward_value`
- `recommended_program.url` → `product.url`
- `recommended_program.reward_type` → `product.reward_type`
- `recommended_program.cookie_days` → `product.cookie_days`
- `recommended_program.tags` → `product.tags`

**Chaining from S3**: If `affiliate-blog-builder` was run, use `products_featured` for the comparison page's `compare_with` list.

If the user says "now make a landing page for it" after running S1 — use the recommended program. No need to ask again.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Product Info

If `product` data is available from S1 chaining or user input, use it directly. Otherwise:

1. Use `web_search` to research the product: `"[product name] features pricing review"`
2. Gather: name, description, key features (3-6), pricing, target audience, top competitors
3. If `page_type = comparison` and `compare_with` is empty:
   - Search: `"best alternatives to [product.name]" OR "[product.name] vs"`
   - Find 1-2 competitors with pricing, features, and positioning

### Step 2: Plan Page Structure

Read `references/conversion-principles.md` for AIDA framework, CTA placement, and design rules.

Choose `page_type` if not specified:
- If user mentions "vs", "compare", "comparison", or provides `compare_with` → `comparison`
- Otherwise → `single`

Plan the page sections based on type:

**Single product:**
1. FTC disclosure (above fold)
2. Hero: headline + subtitle + primary CTA + trust signal
3. Trust bar: rating, user count, press mention
4. Features: 3-column grid (3-6 features as benefits)
5. Pricing: price + CTA
6. Testimonial: one strong quote
7. Who is this for: audience list
8. FAQ: 4-6 questions addressing objections
9. Final CTA: headline + CTA button
10. Footer: Affitor branding

**Comparison:**
1. FTC disclosure (above fold)
2. Hero: "[A] vs [B]" headline + subtitle
3. Comparison table: feature rows with winner highlights
4. Individual product sections: description + pros/cons + CTA each
5. Winner callout: clear recommendation with reasoning
6. FAQ: 4-6 comparison-specific questions
7. Dual CTA: buttons for top 2 products
8. Footer: Affitor branding

Map the user's `color_scheme` to CSS custom properties:
- `blue` → `--color-primary: #2563eb`
- `green` → `--color-primary: #059669`
- `purple` → `--color-primary: #7c3aed`
- `orange` → `--color-primary: #ea580c`
- `dark` → `--color-primary: #3b82f6; --color-bg: #0f172a; --color-surface: #1e293b; --color-text: #f1f5f9`
- Hex code → use directly as `--color-primary`

### Step 3: Write Full HTML

Read the matching template from `templates/`:
- `templates/single-product.html` for `page_type = single`
- `templates/comparison.html` for `page_type = comparison`

Use the template as a structural guide. Write a complete HTML file with:

**Content rules:**
- All CSS must be inline (in a `<style>` tag) — no external stylesheets
- No JavaScript dependencies — pure HTML/CSS (JS only for non-essential progressive enhancement like FAQ accordion)
- System font stack — no external font loading
- Mobile-first responsive design (test at 375px width mentally)
- All affiliate links use the user's URL with `target="_blank" rel="noopener"`
- Replace ALL template placeholder content with real product data
- Write compelling copy based on the `angle` — don't be generic

**Required elements:**
- FTC disclosure visible before the first affiliate link — read `shared/references/ftc-compliance.md` and use the **medium** format
- Minimum 3 CTAs distributed through the page (hero, mid-page, bottom)
- "Built with Affiliate Skills by Affitor" footer — read `shared/references/affitor-branding.md` for exact HTML
- `<meta name="viewport">` tag for mobile
- `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` for SEO

**Things to AVOID:**
- No external resources (fonts, images, scripts, stylesheets)
- No placeholder text like "[insert here]" — write complete content
- No fake testimonials — use realistic but clearly example quotes, or omit if unethical
- No navigation menu — this is a landing page, not a website
- No Affitor branding in the page body (only in the footer)

### Step 4: Output

Present the final output in this structure:

**Part 1: Page Summary**
```
Type: [single/comparison]
Product: [product name]
Angle: [marketing angle used]
Color: [color scheme applied]
CTAs: [number of CTA buttons]
Sections: [list of sections]
DEPLOY
```

### Step 5: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] FTC disclosure visible before first affiliate link (medium format)
- [ ] ≥3 CTAs distributed: hero section, mid-page, bottom
- [ ] `<meta name="viewport">` tag present for mobile
- [ ] Self-contained HTML: zero external resources (fonts, images, scripts, stylesheets)
- [ ] "Built with Affiliate Skills by Affitor" footer present
- [ ] No placeholder text like "[insert here]"

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
landing_page:
  type: string              # "single" | "comparison"
  product_name: string      # Primary product name
  angle: string             # Marketing angle used
  color_scheme: string      # Color scheme applied
  html: string              # Complete self-contained HTML
  filename: string          # Suggested filename (e.g., "heygen-landing.html")

products_featured:          # All products on the page
  - name: string
    url: string             # Affiliate URL
    role: string            # "primary" | "compared"
    cta_count: number       # Number of CTAs for this product

deploy:
  local: string             # "Open [filename] in browser"
  netlify: string           # Netlify Drop URL
  vercel: string            # Vercel deploy command
  github_pages: string      # GitHub Pages instructions
```

## Output Format

Present the output as three clearly separated sections:
1. **Page Summary** — type, product, angle, structure overview
2. **HTML** — the complete file in a code block, ready to save and deploy
3. **Deploy Instructions** — how to get the page live

The HTML should be **immediately deployable** — save it as a `.html` file, open in a browser, and it works. No build step, no dependencies.

## Error Handling

- **No product provided**: "I need a product to create a landing page for. Run `/affiliate-program-search` first to find one, or tell me the product name and I'll research it."
- **Comparison with only 1 product**: Auto-search for 1-2 competitors using `web_search`. Search: `"best alternatives to [product]"`.
- **No pricing info found**: Use `web_search` for `"[product] pricing"`. If still unavailable: include a "Check Current Pricing" CTA instead of a specific price.
- **Unknown color scheme**: Default to blue (`#2563eb`). Inform user: "I used blue as the default. You can pass a hex code like `#ff6600` for a custom color."
- **Product has no public info**: Use `web_search` to research. If insufficient: "I couldn't find enough info about [product] to build a credible landing page. Can you provide features, pricing, and target audience?"

## Examples

### Example 1: Single Product (chained from S1)
**User**: "Create a landing page for HeyGen"
**Context**: S1 previously returned HeyGen as recommended_program
**Action**: Auto-detect page_type=single, pick up HeyGen data from S1, read single-product template, generate complete HTML with blue theme.

### Example 2: Comparison Page
**User**: "Build a comparison page: HeyGen vs Synthesia vs Colossyan"
**Action**: page_type=comparison, primary product=HeyGen (if from S1), compare_with=[Synthesia, Colossyan], web_search for competitor details, generate comparison HTML.

### Example 3: Custom Color
**User**: "Make a dark-themed landing page for Semrush with an SEO angle"
**Action**: page_type=single, color_scheme=dark, angle="SEO", web_search Semrush for features/pricing, generate HTML with dark theme.

### Example 4: Minimal Input
**User**: "Landing page for this product" (after S1)
**Action**: Pick up S1 recommended_program, default page_type=single, default color=blue, auto-generate angle from product strengths.

> **Path within category:** `skills/landing/webinar-registration-page/SKILL.md`


# Webinar Registration Page

Build a high-converting webinar or live training registration page as a self-contained HTML file. Features a live JavaScript countdown timer, speaker credibility section, session agenda, social proof, and a registration form that captures email leads. On registration, visitors are confirmed and teased toward the affiliate offer that will be featured in the webinar itself.

## When to Use

- User is hosting a webinar, live training, workshop, or online event
- User wants to build an email list of warm leads before promoting an affiliate product
- User says "webinar page", "event registration", "live training page", "workshop signup"
- User is running a "free training" funnel — a common high-converting affiliate strategy
- The affiliate product is the natural solution to be revealed or promoted during the event

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Event Details

Parse the user's request for:
- **Event title**: the name of the webinar/training
- **Presenter name and bio**: who is presenting (can be the user)
- **Date and time**: when the event happens (for the countdown timer)
- **Topic**: what the training covers
- **Affiliate product**: the product that will be featured/promoted in the webinar

**If event details are missing, ask for:**
1. "What is your webinar about? Give me a title or topic."
2. "When is it? Date, time, and timezone please."
3. "What affiliate product will you feature or recommend in the webinar?"

**If user has no real event** (wants a template/evergreen page):
- Offer "evergreen" mode: countdown timer counts down to a fake "next session" time (resets every week), always showing 3-7 days away
- Note in output: "This uses an evergreen countdown — it will always show a near-future date. Replace with a real date when you have one."

**Common webinar funnel structures:**
| Structure | Description | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| Free training → pitch | 45-60 min training, last 15 min pitches affiliate product | High-ticket SaaS, courses |
| Live demo → offer | Demo the product live, include affiliate link in follow-up | Software tools |
| Expert interview → recommendation | Interview + affiliate product recommendation | Authority-building niches |
| Challenge / workshop | Multi-day challenge, affiliate product is the tool | Fitness, marketing, business |

### Step 2: Plan the Page Structure

Read `references/conversion-principles.md` for event page conversion principles.

A webinar registration page must create urgency (countdown), credibility (speaker), and anticipation (agenda) while making registration as frictionless as possible.

Page sections:
1. **Urgency Bar** (top, sticky) — "Free Live Training: [Topic] — [Date at Time timezone] — [N seats remaining]"
2. **Hero Section**:
   - Event label: "FREE LIVE WEBINAR" or "FREE TRAINING"
   - Headline: the transformation promise of the event
   - Sub-headline: what attendees will learn + who it's for
   - Date/time with timezone
   - Registration form (first name + email + submit)
   - Seat scarcity signal: "Limited to [N] attendees"
3. **Countdown Timer** (below hero fold):
   - Live JavaScript countdown: Days / Hours / Minutes / Seconds
   - Label: "The training starts in:"
4. **What You'll Learn** — 4-6 bullet points (specific outcomes, not vague topics)
5. **Speaker Section**:
   - Name + headshot placeholder (styled CSS avatar)
   - Role / credentials
   - 2-3 sentence bio establishing expertise
   - Social proof: "Helped [N] people [outcome]"
6. **Agenda Section** — 3-5 session blocks with time + title + brief description
7. **Who This Is For** — 4-5 bullet points naming the ideal attendee (and 2 "this is NOT for you if" bullets)
8. **Testimonials** — 2-3 from past attendees (or representative examples)
9. **FAQ** — 5-7 questions about the event logistics
10. **Second Registration Form** — repeat below the fold for scrollers
11. **Footer** — FTC disclosure, privacy note, Affitor attribution

**Affiliate integration in the webinar funnel:**
The registration page itself should NOT aggressively sell the affiliate product — that's the webinar's job. But it should:
- Tease the product in the "What You'll Learn" section: "Discover the exact tool I use to [outcome] (I'll share the link during the training)"
- Include a subtle line in the description: "We'll cover [topic] using [Product] — the tool that [benefit]"

### Step 3: Build the Countdown Timer

The countdown timer is the most technically important element. Implement it correctly:

```javascript
function getEventDate() {
  // Replace with actual event timestamp
  return new Date('[ISO_DATE_STRING]');
}

function updateCountdown() {
  const now = new Date();
  const event = getEventDate();
  const diff = event - now;

  if (diff <= 0) {
    document.getElementById('countdown').innerHTML =
      '<div class="countdown-ended">The training has started! <a href="[join_url]">Join now →</a></div>';
    return;
  }

  const days = Math.floor(diff / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
  const hours = Math.floor((diff % (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)) / (1000 * 60 * 60));
  const minutes = Math.floor((diff % (1000 * 60 * 60)) / (1000 * 60));
  const seconds = Math.floor((diff % (1000 * 60)) / 1000);

  // Update DOM elements
  document.getElementById('cd-days').textContent = String(days).padStart(2, '0');
  document.getElementById('cd-hours').textContent = String(hours).padStart(2, '0');
  document.getElementById('cd-minutes').textContent = String(minutes).padStart(2, '0');
  document.getElementById('cd-seconds').textContent = String(seconds).padStart(2, '0');
}

setInterval(updateCountdown, 1000);
updateCountdown();
```

**Evergreen mode** (if no real date provided):
```javascript
function getEventDate() {
  const now = new Date();
  const daysUntilNext = 5; // Always 5 days away
  return new Date(now.getTime() + (daysUntilNext * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));
}
```

### Step 4: Write the Full HTML

**Copy requirements:**

*Event headline formula:*
- "How to [Achieve Specific Outcome] in [Timeframe] — Even If [Common Objection]"
- "The [Adjective] [Method/System] That Helped [N] [People] [Achieve Outcome]"
- "Free Live Training: [Topic] — [Specific Claim About the Session]"

*Urgency bar copy:*
- "FREE LIVE TRAINING — [Short Title] — [Weekday, Month Day] at [Time] [TZ] — [N] Spots Left"

*What You'll Learn bullets (outcome-first format):*
- "[Specific skill/tactic] — so you can [specific result]"
- "The [method/framework] that [social proof claim]"
- "Why [common mistake] is killing your results — and how to fix it in [timeframe]"

*Speaker bio (credibility elements to include):*
- Years of experience or number of clients/students
- Specific, verifiable result they achieved
- Notable publication, company, or platform they've appeared on
- Why they're qualified to teach this specific topic

*Agenda block format:*
```
[Time Marker] — [Session Title]
[One sentence description of what happens in this block]
```

**HTML/CSS requirements:**
- All CSS inline in `<style>` block
- Mobile-first responsive
- Countdown timer: large digits in boxes with labels (Days/Hours/Min/Sec)
- Color scheme applied to: urgency bar, countdown boxes, CTA buttons, section accents
- Registration form: first name + email fields + submit button
- Form submission: JS redirect to a confirmation page or affiliate thank-you URL
- Speaker avatar: styled CSS circle placeholder (bg color + initials)
- Agenda: timeline-style visual with numbered steps or time markers

**Required elements:**
- FTC disclosure in footer: "This training may reference affiliate products. We may earn a commission on purchases."
- Privacy note near form: "No spam. Unsubscribe anytime. Your information is never shared."
- "Built with Affiliate Skills by Affitor" footer from `shared/references/affitor-branding.md`

### Step 5: Format Output

**Part 1: Page Summary**
```
Event: [title]
Presenter: [name]
Date/Time: [event date] OR [evergreen mode]
Topic: [what the webinar covers]
Affiliate Product: [product featured in the webinar]

                            # Used to customize setup instructions
```

### Step 6: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] FTC disclosure in footer mentioning affiliate products
- [ ] Countdown timer JavaScript calculates correctly
- [ ] Form has first name + email fields + submit button
- [ ] Self-contained HTML: speaker avatar is CSS placeholder, no external images
- [ ] "Built with Affiliate Skills by Affitor" footer present
- [ ] Urgency bar present at top with date/time and scarcity signal

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
registration_page:
  event_title: string
  presenter_name: string
  event_date: string        # "2025-04-15T19:00:00-05:00" or "evergreen"
  countdown_mode: string    # "live" | "evergreen"
  color_scheme: string
  html: string
  filename: string          # e.g., "ai-video-mastery-webinar.html"

funnel:
  step_1: string            # "Visitor sees registration page"
  step_2: string            # "Visitor registers (submits email)"
  step_3: string            # "Visitor attends webinar"
  step_4: string            # "Affiliate product featured during webinar"
  step_5: string            # "Visitor clicks affiliate link"

affiliate_integration:
  product_name: string
  tease_on_page: string     # How the product is referenced on the reg page
  reveal_in_webinar: string # Suggested moment to introduce the product

deploy:
  local: string
  platform_specific: string # Instructions for the user's webinar platform
```

## Output Format

Present as three sections:
1. **Page Summary** — event details, presenter, countdown mode, affiliate integration plan
2. **HTML** — complete file in a code block
3. **Setup Instructions** — how to set the event date, wire the form, and deploy

## Error Handling

- **No event date provided**: "Do you have a specific date, or should I use evergreen mode (timer always shows ~5 days away)?"
- **No presenter name**: Default to "Your Host" as a placeholder, note: "Replace 'Your Host' with your name and bio before publishing."
- **No agenda provided**: Auto-generate a 4-part agenda based on the topic. Inform user: "I've created a sample agenda — customize the timing and details."
- **User wants form to actually register people**: Explain static HTML limitation. Recommend Zoom Webinar registration link, Demio embed, or Mailchimp form with the webinar link in the welcome email.
- **Evergreen webinar (not live)**: If the user says "evergreen webinar" or "automated webinar", shift framing away from "live" language. Replace "Join us live" with "Watch the free training". Keep countdown for urgency but use softer language.

## Examples

**Example 1: Standard live webinar**
User: "Build a webinar registration page for my free training: 'How to Create AI Videos for YouTube' on April 20 at 7pm EST, I'm promoting HeyGen"
Action: event with real date, presenter=user, affiliate_product=HeyGen, live countdown to April 20, purple theme, full page with teaser of HeyGen in the "what you'll learn" section.

**Example 2: Evergreen training**
User: "Create an evergreen webinar registration page for a training about email marketing, I'll promote Klaviyo"
Action: countdown_mode=evergreen, topic="email marketing", affiliate_product=Klaviyo, always-on urgency, blue theme.

**Example 3: With full details**
User: "Webinar reg page — 'The AI Content Strategy That Gets 10K Visitors/Month', Jane Smith presenting, May 5 at 6pm PT, 4-part agenda, promoting Semrush"
Action: Full page with Jane Smith's bio, custom agenda, live countdown to May 5, Semrush teased in agenda item 3, purple theme.

**Example 4: Chained from S1**
User: "Build a webinar registration page around this product"
Context: S1 returned HeyGen as recommended_program
Action: affiliate_product=HeyGen from S1, auto-generate event title based on HeyGen's main use case, ask for presenter name and event date, then build full page.

## 21. Expert Skill: bio-link-deployer
> **Path within category:** `skills/distribution/bio-link-deployer/SKILL.md`


# Bio Link Deployer

Create a Linktree-style hub page that links all your affiliate content — blog posts, landing pages, social profiles, and product links — in one place. Output is a single self-contained HTML file with 3 theme options, mobile-first (90%+ bio link traffic is mobile), deployable anywhere.

## Stage

S5: Distribution — The central hub that ties your entire affiliate funnel together. Put this link in your social media bios, email signatures, and anywhere you need one link to rule them all. Unlike Linktree, you own the page and pay nothing.

## When to Use

- User wants a link-in-bio page for social media profiles
- User wants a single page linking all their affiliate content
- User says anything like "linktree", "bio link", "link page", "link in bio", "all my links"
- User has multiple affiliate products/blog posts/landing pages and needs a hub
- User wants a free alternative to Linktree/Beacons/Stan Store

## Input Schema

```yaml
user_name: string           # REQUIRED — display name or handle (e.g., "@alexcreator")

tagline: string             # OPTIONAL — short bio under the name
                            # Default: auto-generated from link categories

avatar_url: string          # OPTIONAL — URL to profile image
                            # Default: emoji placeholder based on niche

links:                      # REQUIRED — at least 3 links
  - label: string           # Display text (e.g., "HeyGen — AI Video Creator")
    url: string             # Destination URL
    category: string        # Group label (e.g., "Tools", "My Content", "Connect")
    icon: string            # OPTIONAL — emoji for visual (e.g., "🎬")

theme: string               # OPTIONAL — "minimal" | "dark" | "gradient"
                            # Default: "minimal"
```

**Chaining context**: If earlier skills (S1-S4) were run in the conversation, use these Output Schema fields:
- S1 `recommended_program.url` + `.name` → add as "Featured Tools" links
- S2 `posts[].platform` → link to the user's social platform profiles
- S3 `products_featured[].url` + `.name` → add as "My Content" links (blog posts)
- S4 `landing_page.filename` or deployed URL → add as "Landing Pages" links
- S4 `products_featured[].url` + `.name` → add as product links if not already included

If the user says "make me a bio link with everything we've done" — gather all products, blog posts, and landing pages from the conversation and organize them into categories.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Links

Collect links from one of these sources:

**Option A — User provides links directly:**
Use the `links` array as-is. Ensure each link has a label, url, and category.

**Option B — Gather from conversation context:**
If prior skills (S1-S4) were run, collect:
- Product affiliate URLs → category: "Featured Tools"
- Blog post URLs → category: "My Content"
- Landing page URLs → category: "Landing Pages"
- Social media profiles (if mentioned) → category: "Connect"

**Option C — User provides partial info:**
Ask for missing required fields. Minimum: user_name + 3 links.

Organize links by category. Suggested category order:
1. "Featured Tools" (affiliate product links — money links first)
2. "My Content" (blog posts, landing pages, videos)
3. "Connect" (social media, email, website)

### Step 2: Build Page

Read `templates/bio-link.html` for the page structure and all three theme variants.

Apply the chosen `theme`:

**Minimal (default):**
- Clean white background, subtle borders
- Dark text, light gray accents
- Rounded corners (12px)
- Best for: professional, clean look

**Dark:**
- Dark navy background (#0f172a)
- Light text, blue accents
- Subtle card borders
- Best for: tech, gaming, modern brands

**Gradient:**
- Purple-to-blue gradient background
- White text, frosted-glass link cards
- Large rounded corners (24px)
- Best for: creative, lifestyle, bold brands

Set CSS variables in `:root` based on the chosen theme. Remove the other theme blocks from the template.

If `avatar_url` is provided, use an `<img>` tag. Otherwise, use the emoji placeholder div with an emoji matching the user's niche (default: 🚀).

### Step 3: Output

Present the final output in this structure:

**Part 1: Page Summary**
```
Name: [user_name]
Theme: [minimal/dark/gradient]
Links: [count]
Categories: [list]
DEPLOY
```

### Step 4: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] All links are functional URLs (not placeholder)
- [ ] Mobile-first layout renders correctly at 375px width
- [ ] Theme CSS custom properties applied consistently
- [ ] FTC disclosure present if any affiliate links included
- [ ] "Built with Affiliate Skills by Affitor" footer present
- [ ] Money links (affiliate) ordered before social/content links

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
bio_link:
  user_name: string         # Display name
  theme: string             # Applied theme
  html: string              # Complete self-contained HTML
  filename: string          # Suggested filename (e.g., "index.html")
  link_count: number        # Total links on the page
  categories: string[]      # Categories used

deploy:
  local: string             # "Open index.html in browser"
  netlify: string           # Netlify Drop instructions
  vercel: string            # Vercel deploy command
  github_pages: string      # GitHub Pages instructions
```

## Output Format

Present the output as three clearly separated sections:
1. **Page Summary** — name, theme, link count, categories
2. **HTML** — the complete file in a code block, ready to save
3. **Deploy Instructions** — how to get the page live and add to social bios

The HTML should be **immediately usable** — save as `.html`, open in browser, and it works. No build step, no dependencies, mobile-optimized.

## Error Handling

- **No links provided**: "I need at least 3 links to create your bio page. List your affiliate product URLs, blog posts, social profiles, or landing pages."
- **No user_name**: "What name or handle should I display? (e.g., @yourusername)"
- **Invalid avatar_url**: Use emoji placeholder instead. Note: "I couldn't load the avatar image, so I used an emoji placeholder. You can replace it later by editing the HTML."
- **Unknown theme**: Default to minimal. Inform: "I used the 'minimal' theme. Available themes: minimal, dark, gradient."
- **Too many links (20+)**: Include all but suggest: "That's a lot of links — consider featuring your top 10-15 and linking to a full directory page for the rest."
- **No categories provided**: Auto-categorize based on URL patterns (social domains → "Connect", blog URLs → "My Content", product URLs → "Tools").

## Examples

### Example 1: Full Input
**User**: "Create a dark-themed bio link page for @sarahcontent with these links: HeyGen (heygen.com/ref), Semrush (semrush.com/ref), My HeyGen Review (blog.com/heygen), Follow on X (x.com/sarah)"
**Action**: theme=dark, organize into 3 categories (Tools, Content, Connect), generate HTML.

### Example 2: From Conversation Context
**User**: "Make me a bio link page with everything we've done today"
**Context**: S1 found HeyGen, S3 wrote a blog post, S4 made a landing page
**Action**: Gather all URLs from conversation, auto-categorize, default theme=minimal, generate HTML.

### Example 3: Minimal Input
**User**: "I need a link in bio page"
**Action**: Ask for user_name and links. Provide example: "What's your display name and what links do you want? For example: product URLs, blog posts, social profiles."

## References

- `templates/bio-link.html` — Bio link page template with 3 theme variants (minimal, dark, gradient). Read in Step 2.
- `references/domain-setup.md` — Hosting and domain setup guide for Netlify Drop, Vercel, GitHub Pages. Read in Step 3.
- `shared/references/ftc-compliance.md` — FTC disclosure for bio link pages (footer text). Reference in Step 2.
- `shared/references/affitor-branding.md` — Affitor footer HTML. Reference in Step 2.
- `shared/references/flywheel-connections.md` — master flywheel connection map

## Revenue & Action Plan

### Expected Outcomes
- **Revenue potential**: Your bio link is the funnel entrance for ALL social media traffic. Average bio link CTR is 1-3% of profile visitors. With 5,000 monthly profile views → 50-150 clicks → at 3% affiliate conversion and $50 commission = $75-225/month. Top creators with optimized bio links report $500-2,000/month
- **Benchmark**: Money links (affiliate products) placed at position 1-2 get 60% of all bio link clicks. Position matters more than design
- **Key metric to track**: Per-link click rate — which links get clicked most? Reorder weekly to keep the highest-performing link at the top

### Do This Right Now (15 min)
1. **Deploy the page** — use Netlify Drop (drag and drop, 30 seconds)
2. **Update ALL your social bios** — Instagram, TikTok, X, LinkedIn, YouTube — with the new bio link URL
3. **Verify on mobile** — 90%+ of bio link traffic is mobile. Open the link on your phone right now
4. **Bookmark your analytics** — if using Netlify, check Netlify Analytics or add a free analytics snippet

### Track Your Results
After 7 days: which link gets the most clicks? Is it your top affiliate product? If not, reorder links — put the money link at position #1. Check weekly and rotate based on performance.

> **Next step — copy-paste this prompt:**
> "Deploy my bio link page to GitHub Pages with a custom domain" → runs `github-pages-deployer`

## Flywheel Connections

### Feeds Into
- `conversion-tracker` (S6) — deployed link hub URLs to track clicks
- `github-pages-deployer` (S5) — bio link HTML to deploy

### Fed By
- `landing-page-creator` (S4) — landing page URLs to add to link hub
- `squeeze-page-builder` (S4) — squeeze page URLs for link hub
- `webinar-registration-page` (S4) — registration page URLs for link hub

### Feedback Loop
- `conversion-tracker` (S6) reveals which bio links get the most clicks → reorder links to put highest-converting at top

## Quality Gate

Before delivering output, verify:

1. Would I share this on MY personal social?
2. Contains specific, surprising detail? (not generic)
3. Respects reader's intelligence?
4. Remarkable enough to share? (Purple Cow test)
5. Irresistible offer framing? (if S4 offer skills ran)

Any NO → rewrite before delivering.

## 22. Expert Skill: social-media-scheduler
> **Path within category:** `skills/distribution/social-media-scheduler/SKILL.md`


# Social Media Scheduler

Generate a complete 30-day social media content calendar with post copy, hashtags, and scheduling times for LinkedIn, X (Twitter), Facebook, and Reddit. Follows the 80/20 rule: 80% value and engagement content, 20% affiliate promotions. Every post is ready to copy-paste or load into a scheduling tool.

## Stage

S5: Distribution — Social media is the top free traffic channel for affiliate marketers. This skill eliminates "what do I post today?" paralysis by giving you 30 days of content in one shot, optimized for each platform's algorithm and audience behavior.

## When to Use

- User wants a content plan for promoting an affiliate product over 30 days
- User asks for a social media calendar, posting schedule, or content strategy
- User wants platform-specific posts (LinkedIn professional angle, X casual, Reddit community-first)
- User has an audience on one or more social platforms and wants consistent posting
- Chaining from S1 (product research) — user found a product and now wants a social plan

## Input Schema

```yaml
product:
  name: string              # REQUIRED — product being promoted (e.g., "Semrush")
  affiliate_url: string     # REQUIRED — affiliate tracking link
  category: string          # OPTIONAL — e.g., "SEO tool", "AI writing tool"
  key_benefits: string[]    # OPTIONAL — top benefits. Inferred if not provided.
  price: string             # OPTIONAL — e.g., "starts at $119/mo"
  free_trial: boolean       # OPTIONAL — does the product have a free trial?

creator:
  niche: string             # REQUIRED — your content niche (e.g., "SEO for freelancers")
  audience: string          # REQUIRED — who follows you (e.g., "freelance SEO consultants")
  tone: string              # OPTIONAL — "professional" | "casual" | "educational" | "bold"
                            # Default: "educational"
  personal_story: string    # OPTIONAL — brief personal experience with the product

platforms:
  - string                  # REQUIRED — list of platforms: "linkedin" | "x" | "facebook" | "reddit"
                            # Default: ["linkedin", "x"]

calendar:
  start_date: string        # OPTIONAL — ISO date (e.g., "2026-04-01"). Default: next Monday.
  posts_per_week: number    # OPTIONAL — 3-7. Default: 5 (weekdays only)
  promotion_ratio: number   # OPTIONAL — % of posts that are affiliate promo. Default: 20
```

**Chaining context**: If S1 (product research) was run, auto-fill `product.name`, `product.affiliate_url`, `product.key_benefits`. If S3 (blog post) was run, include 2 posts linking to the blog post. If S4 (landing page) was run, include posts driving to the landing page.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Inputs

Collect required fields. If product details are available from S1, use them. Otherwise ask:
- "What product are you promoting and what's your affiliate link?"
- "What's your content niche and who's your target audience?"
- "Which platforms: LinkedIn, X, Facebook, Reddit? (pick 1-4)"

### Step 2: Plan the 30-Day Arc

Divide the month into 4 weeks with a strategic arc:

| Week | Theme | Promo Ratio |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Week 1 | Education + awareness — establish authority, zero sell | 0% |
| Week 2 | Problem agitation — surface pain points the product solves | 10% |
| Week 3 | Solution introduction — introduce product, soft sell | 30% |
| Week 4 | Social proof + urgency — testimonials, results, hard CTA | 40% |

Overall month target: 20% promotional, 80% value/engagement.

**Post type mix** (apply across all 4 weeks):
- 30% Educational (how-to tips, frameworks, industry data)
- 20% Engagement (questions, polls, hot takes, controversial opinions)
- 20% Personal / storytelling (lessons learned, behind the scenes, wins)
- 15% Curated (share tools, articles, resources — without affiliate link)
- 15% Promotional (affiliate link posts — FTC disclosed)

### Step 3: Write Posts Per Platform

Write distinct copy for each platform. Do NOT copy the same post across platforms.

**LinkedIn** (professional, 150-300 words per post):
- Hook line: bold statement or specific number in first line (LinkedIn shows 2 lines before "see more")
- Format: short paragraphs with line breaks, 3-5 bullet points for how-to posts
- Hashtags: 3-5 at end (#SEO #ContentMarketing #FreelanceTips)
- CTA: "Comment below", "Save this for later", "Link in first comment" (for affiliate posts)
- Best posting times: Tue-Thu 8-10am and 12-2pm (user's timezone)

**X / Twitter** (concise, punchy, under 280 characters for single tweets):
- Hook: strong opener, no fluff
- Thread format for educational posts: number each tweet (1/ 2/ 3/)
- Hashtags: 1-2 only (#SEO #AItools)
- CTA: "RT if this helped", "Drop your take", direct link for promo posts
- Best posting times: Mon-Fri 9am and 6pm

**Facebook** (conversational, 100-200 words):
- More personal and community tone than LinkedIn
- Ask questions to drive comments (algorithm rewards comment activity)
- Hashtags: 2-3 only
- Image prompt included (describe what image to use)
- Best posting times: Wed-Fri 1-3pm

**Reddit** (community-first, never salesy):
- Identify 2-3 relevant subreddits for the niche (e.g., r/SEO, r/juststart, r/freelance)
- Lead with genuine value — post as a community member, not a marketer
- Affiliate link goes in comments, not the post body (per most subreddit rules)
- Title: specific and searchable (Reddit posts surface in Google)
- Format: detailed paragraph, then list takeaways
- Disclosure: "(Affiliate link in comments)" in post body
- Post max: 4 Reddit posts per month to avoid spam detection

### Step 4: Format the Calendar

Output a table-based calendar followed by individual post copy blocks.

**Calendar table format:**

```
WEEK 1 — Education & Awareness
| Day | Platform | Type | Topic |
|-----|----------|------|-------|
| Mon Apr 7 | LinkedIn | Educational | 5 SEO mistakes killing your traffic |
| Tue Apr 8 | X | Engagement | Hot take: [opinion] |
...
```

Then write each post in full:

```
[Full post copy, ready to paste]

Hashtags: #tag1 #tag2 #tag3
CTA: [specific action]
Best time to post: [time]
[If promo: Affiliate disclosure included]

## 23. Expert Skill: github-pages-deployer
> **Path within category:** `skills/distribution/github-pages-deployer/SKILL.md`


# GitHub Pages Deployer

Generate a complete, ready-to-deploy GitHub Pages setup for affiliate landing pages, bio link hubs, and blog posts. Outputs the full repo file structure, a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for automatic deploys, and step-by-step instructions for custom domain configuration with SSL. Free hosting, no credit card required.

## Stage

S5: Distribution — GitHub Pages is the most underused free hosting platform in affiliate marketing. 100GB bandwidth/month, free SSL, custom domains, and automatic deploys from Git. This skill takes any HTML output from S4 (landing page) or S5 (bio-link) and gets it live on the internet in under 10 minutes.

## When to Use

- User wants to deploy a landing page (from S4) to a free host
- User wants to deploy a bio link page (from S5 bio-link-deployer) to a free host
- User wants free static hosting with a custom domain and SSL
- User already has HTML files and wants to publish them without paying for hosting
- User wants automated deploys so pushing to main branch auto-updates the live site
- User wants to host a simple affiliate blog or resource page for free

## Input Schema

```yaml
site:
  type: string              # REQUIRED — "landing-page" | "bio-link" | "blog" | "resource-page"
  html_content: string      # REQUIRED — the HTML content to deploy (full file or description)
                            # If S4 or bio-link-deployer was run, use that output automatically
  title: string             # REQUIRED — site title (used in repo name and meta)
  description: string       # OPTIONAL — meta description for SEO

repo:
  name: string              # OPTIONAL — GitHub repo name (auto-generated from title if omitted)
                            # e.g., "heygen-review" or "alex-bio-links"
  username: string          # OPTIONAL — GitHub username. Used in generated URLs.
                            # If not provided, use "[your-username]" as placeholder.
  visibility: string        # OPTIONAL — "public" | "private". Default: "public"
                            # Note: private repos require GitHub Pro for Pages

domain:
  custom: string            # OPTIONAL — custom domain (e.g., "links.yourdomain.com")
  subdomain: string         # OPTIONAL — subdomain type: "apex" | "subdomain"
                            # Apex = yourdomain.com, Subdomain = www.yourdomain.com

deploy:
  method: string            # OPTIONAL — "github-actions" | "manual". Default: "github-actions"
  branch: string            # OPTIONAL — source branch. Default: "main"
```

**Chaining context**: If S4 (landing-page-creator) or S5 (bio-link-deployer) was run earlier in the conversation, automatically use that HTML output as `site.html_content`. Do not ask the user to paste it again.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Inputs

Check if an HTML page was generated earlier in the conversation (S4 landing page or bio-link page). If yes, confirm: "I'll deploy the [page type] we built earlier. What's your GitHub username?"

If no prior HTML exists:
- Ask for HTML content or page description
- Offer to call S4 or bio-link-deployer first: "Want me to create the page first, then set up the deploy?"

### Step 2: Generate Repo Structure

Create the complete file and folder structure for the GitHub Pages repo.

**Standard structure for a single-page site:**

```
[repo-name]/
├── index.html              # Main page (the affiliate landing page or bio link)
├── assets/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── style.css       # External CSS if extracted from HTML (optional)
│   └── images/
│       └── .gitkeep        # Placeholder — add images here
├── CNAME                   # Only if custom domain is set
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── deploy.yml      # GitHub Actions workflow
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

**For multi-page blog/resource site, add:**

```
├── blog/
│   ├── index.html          # Blog listing page
│   └── [post-slug]/
│       └── index.html      # Individual post pages
├── about/
│   └── index.html
└── sitemap.xml
```

### Step 3: Generate the GitHub Actions Workflow

Write the `deploy.yml` file that automatically deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:       # Allow manual trigger from GitHub UI

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: '.'         # Deploy from repo root

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

This workflow uses the official GitHub Pages Actions (no third-party dependencies, no tokens needed).

### Step 4: Generate the CNAME File (if custom domain)

If `domain.custom` is provided, create a `CNAME` file with just the domain:

```
links.yourdomain.com
```

For apex domains (`yourdomain.com`), the CNAME file contains the bare domain. GitHub Pages handles the redirect from `www` to apex automatically when configured correctly.

### Step 5: Generate DNS Configuration Instructions

Provide exact DNS records to add in the user's domain registrar (Cloudflare, Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.).

**For subdomain (e.g., links.yourdomain.com):**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: links
Value: [username].github.io
TTL: Auto or 3600
```

**For apex domain (yourdomain.com):**
```
Type: A  Name: @  Value: 185.199.108.153
Type: A  Name: @  Value: 185.199.109.153
Type: A  Name: @  Value: 185.199.110.153
Type: A  Name: @  Value: 185.199.111.153
Type: AAAA  Name: @  Value: 2606:50c0:8000::153
Type: AAAA  Name: @  Value: 2606:50c0:8001::153
Type: AAAA  Name: @  Value: 2606:50c0:8002::153
Type: AAAA  Name: @  Value: 2606:50c0:8003::153
```

Note: GitHub's IP addresses above are current as of 2026. Always verify at https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site

### Step 6: Generate README.md

Write a clean README for the repo:

```markdown
# [Site Title]

Affiliate landing page hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Live Site
[Live URL]

## Deploy
Automatic via GitHub Actions — push to `main` triggers a deploy.

## Powered By
[Affitor](https://affitor.com)
```

### Step 7: Output the Complete Setup

Present all outputs in numbered sections with clear file labels.

### Step 8: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] GitHub Actions YAML is valid syntax
- [ ] CNAME file is correct format if custom domain configured
- [ ] All file paths are valid and consistent
- [ ] Deployment commands are copy-paste ready
- [ ] README.md is included in the repository files

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
repo:
  name: string              # e.g., "heygen-review-2026"
  url: string               # e.g., "https://github.com/[username]/[repo-name]"
  pages_url: string         # e.g., "https://[username].github.io/[repo-name]"
  custom_domain_url: string | null

files:
  - path: string            # e.g., "index.html"
    content: string         # full file content
  - path: ".github/workflows/deploy.yml"
    content: string
  - path: "CNAME"           # null if no custom domain
    content: string | null
  - path: ".gitignore"
    content: string
  - path: "README.md"
    content: string

setup_steps:
  - step: number
    action: string          # e.g., "Create GitHub repo"
    command: string | null  # CLI command if applicable

dns_records: object | null  # DNS config if custom domain provided

estimated_time: string      # e.g., "8-10 minutes"
```

## Output Format

Present in five clearly labeled sections:

**Section 1: Summary**
- Repo name, live URL, custom domain URL (if applicable)
- Estimated time to go live: X minutes

**Section 2: Files to Create**
Each file in its own fenced code block with the file path as the label. User can copy-paste each file's content directly.

**Section 3: GitHub Setup Steps**
Numbered instructions:
1. Create the repo on GitHub (link to github.com/new)
2. Initialize and push (CLI commands provided)
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repo Settings
4. Set source to "GitHub Actions"

**Section 4: DNS Setup** (only if custom domain)
Exact records to add, formatted as a table. Provider-specific notes for Cloudflare users (Proxy OFF for GitHub Pages).

**Section 5: Verification**
How to confirm the deploy worked and SSL is active (usually 5-15 minutes for DNS propagation).

## Error Handling

- **No HTML content and no prior skill output**: "I don't see a page to deploy yet. Want me to create a landing page first (S4), a bio link page, or do you have HTML to paste?"
- **Private repo for free GitHub account**: "Private repos require GitHub Pro ($4/mo) for GitHub Pages. Your options: (1) make the repo public, (2) upgrade to Pro, (3) use Netlify Drop for free private deploys."
- **Custom domain not propagating**: "DNS changes can take 1-48 hours. If it's been over 24 hours, double-check: CNAME file contains exactly the domain, no `https://` prefix; DNS record value is `[username].github.io` (with no trailing slash). Enable Cloudflare proxy OFF (grey cloud) for GitHub Pages to work."
- **GitHub Actions failing**: Common causes: Pages not enabled in repo Settings, branch name mismatch (use `main` not `master`), or `pages: write` permission missing on older repos. Provide troubleshooting checklist.
- **User wants WordPress or dynamic site**: "GitHub Pages only hosts static HTML/CSS/JS — no PHP, no databases. For WordPress or dynamic content, use Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, or a VPS. For a simple affiliate site, static is faster and better for SEO anyway."
- **Repo name taken**: Suggest appending year (`heygen-review-2026`) or niche (`heygen-review-for-creators`).

## Examples

**Example 1: Deploy landing page from S4**
Context: S4 generated a HeyGen landing page HTML.
User: "Deploy this to GitHub Pages. My username is alexmarketer."
Action: Auto-use S4 HTML. Repo name: `heygen-landing`. Pages URL: `https://alexmarketer.github.io/heygen-landing`. Generate all files + deploy instructions.

**Example 2: Deploy bio link with custom domain**
Context: Bio-link-deployer generated a bio page.
User: "Put this on GitHub Pages at links.mysite.com."
Action: Repo + CNAME file with `links.mysite.com`. DNS: CNAME record pointing to `[username].github.io`. Cloudflare note: proxy must be disabled (grey cloud icon).

**Example 3: Multi-page resource site**
User: "I want to host an affiliate resource site on GitHub Pages with a homepage, about page, and 3 blog posts."
Action: Generate multi-page structure. Scaffold all index.html files with placeholder content. Deploy workflow. Note: for a blog with 10+ posts, suggest Jekyll or Eleventy for templating.

## Revenue & Action Plan

### Expected Outcomes
- **Revenue potential**: A deployed landing page or bio link earns 24/7 — it's your always-on salesperson. Free hosting means 100% of revenue is profit. A single landing page can generate $200-1,000/month with consistent traffic
- **Benchmark**: Deployed affiliate pages indexed by Google start ranking within 2-4 weeks. Organic traffic from Google is the highest-converting free traffic source (4-5% conversion vs 1-2% from social)
- **Key metric to track**: Page visits → affiliate link clicks → conversions. Set up `conversion-tracker` immediately after deploying

### Do This Right Now (15 min)
1. **Create the repo and push** — follow the Setup Steps exactly (copy-paste commands)
2. **Verify the deploy** — visit your GitHub Pages URL, confirm the page loads
3. **Submit to Google Search Console** — add `https://[username].github.io/[repo]` so Google indexes it faster
4. **Share the live URL** — post it on social media, add it to your bio link, and send it to your email list

### Track Your Results
After deploying: set up `conversion-tracker` to monitor clicks and conversions. After 30 days, run `seo-audit` to optimize for search rankings. A page that ranks #1 for a buyer-intent keyword can earn $500-2,000/month passively.

> **Next step — copy-paste this prompt:**
> "Set up conversion tracking for my deployed page at [URL]" → runs `conversion-tracker`

## Flywheel Connections

### Feeds Into

> **Path within category:** `skills/distribution/email-drip-sequence/SKILL.md`


# Email Drip Sequence

Write a 5-7 email drip sequence that nurtures new subscribers from cold to warm to buyer. Follows the Welcome → Value → Value → Soft Sell → Hard Sell → Objection Handling → Follow-Up pattern. Each email includes subject line, preview text, body copy, and a single clear CTA.

## Stage

S5: Distribution — Email is the highest-ROI channel for affiliate marketers (avg $42 return per $1 spent). This skill turns a list of subscribers into a predictable revenue stream by delivering value first and selling second.

## When to Use

- User has an email list and wants to promote an affiliate product
- User just launched a lead magnet or opt-in form and needs a welcome sequence
- User wants to automate affiliate promotions via email automation (ConvertKit, Mailchimp, Beehiiv, ActiveCampaign, etc.)
- User says anything like "email sequence", "drip campaign", "email funnel", "nurture series"
- User wants a sequence for a specific product or niche
- Chaining from S1 (research) — user found a product and now wants an email sequence for it

## Input Schema

```yaml
product:
  name: string              # REQUIRED — product name (e.g., "HeyGen")
  affiliate_url: string     # REQUIRED — the affiliate link to promote
  category: string          # OPTIONAL — product category (e.g., "AI video tool")
  reward_value: string      # OPTIONAL — commission amount/percentage (e.g., "30% recurring")
  key_benefits: string[]    # OPTIONAL — top 3 benefits. Auto-researched if not provided.
  price: string             # OPTIONAL — product pricing (e.g., "$29/mo")

audience:
  description: string       # REQUIRED — who are the subscribers? (e.g., "content creators", "SaaS founders")
  pain_point: string        # OPTIONAL — main problem they want solved
  awareness_level: string   # OPTIONAL — "cold" | "warm" | "hot". Default: "cold"

sequence:
  length: number            # OPTIONAL — number of emails: 5, 6, or 7. Default: 7
  send_days: number[]       # OPTIONAL — days to send (e.g., [0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14])
                            # Default: [0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14]
  sender_name: string       # OPTIONAL — from name (e.g., "Alex from ContentPro")
  tone: string              # OPTIONAL — "conversational" | "professional" | "bold"
                            # Default: "conversational"
  lead_magnet: string       # OPTIONAL — what they opted in for (e.g., "AI tools checklist")
```

**Chaining context**: If S1 (product research) was run earlier in the conversation, pull `product.name`, `product.affiliate_url`, `product.key_benefits`, and `product.reward_value` automatically. Do not ask the user to repeat information already provided.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Information

Collect required inputs. If `product.name` and `product.affiliate_url` are present (from user or S1 chain), proceed. Otherwise ask:
- "What product are you promoting and what's your affiliate link?"
- "Who are your subscribers? (e.g., freelancers, SaaS founders, content creators)"

If `product.key_benefits` is not provided, infer 3 benefits from the product name and category using your training knowledge. State: "Based on what I know about [product], I'm using these key benefits: [list]. Correct me if needed."

### Step 2: Plan the Sequence

Map each email to its purpose using the 7-email arc. For a 5-email sequence, drop emails 6 and 7. For a 6-email sequence, drop email 7.

| # | Day | Type | Purpose |
|---|-----|------|---------|
| 1 | 0 | Welcome | Deliver lead magnet, set expectations, build trust |
| 2 | 1 | Value | Teach something useful (no sell) |
| 3 | 3 | Value + Soft Mention | More value, casual mention of the product |
| 4 | 5 | Soft Sell | Introduce the product properly, benefits focus |
| 5 | 7 | Hard Sell | Clear CTA, urgency (limited offer / deadline if available) |
| 6 | 10 | Objection Handling | Answer top 3 objections, social proof |
| 7 | 14 | Follow-Up / Last Chance | "Did you see this?" re-engagement email |

### Step 3: Write Each Email

For each email, write all four components:

**Subject Line**: 40-60 characters. Use curiosity, specificity, or direct benefit. Avoid spam trigger words (free, guaranteed, act now).

**Preview Text**: 80-100 characters. Extends the subject line, adds context or intrigue. Shown in inbox preview.

**Body Copy**:
- Email 1-2: 200-300 words. Focus on value, zero sell pressure.
- Email 3-4: 250-350 words. Introduce product naturally in context.
- Email 5: 300-400 words. Strong pitch, benefits listed, clear CTA button.
- Email 6: 250-300 words. Story-driven or testimonial-anchored.
- Email 7: 150-200 words. Short, punchy re-engagement.

**Formatting rules**:
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- One idea per paragraph
- Conversational opener (use "you", avoid "Dear [Name]")
- Single CTA per email (one link, one action)
- Sign off with sender name + brief sign-off line

**CTA structure**:
- Email 1: CTA = download/access lead magnet (not affiliate link)
- Email 2: CTA = read an article or reply to email (engagement)
- Email 3: CTA = soft mention "check it out" with affiliate link
- Email 4-7: CTA = affiliate link with action verb ("Try [Product] Free", "Get [X]% Off", "Start Your Trial")

### Step 4: Add Compliance Disclosures

Each email that contains an affiliate link must include a one-line FTC disclosure. Place it immediately before or after the affiliate link:

> *Affiliate disclosure: I may earn a commission if you purchase through my link, at no extra cost to you.*

For email clients that strip formatting, also include plain text disclosure in the footer.

### Step 5: Output the Sequence

Present all emails in order. Each email formatted as:

```
Subject: [subject line]
Preview: [preview text]

[Body copy]

[CTA]

[Signature]
SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
```

## Error Handling

- **No affiliate URL provided**: "I'll write the sequence structure now. Drop in your affiliate link where I've marked `[YOUR_AFFILIATE_LINK]` before setting it up in your ESP."
- **Unknown product**: Research the product using web search if possible. If not found, ask: "Can you tell me the top 2-3 benefits of [product]? I'll write the sequence around those."
- **Audience too vague ("everyone")**: Default to "online business owners and marketers." Note: "I used a general audience. For better conversions, replace 'you' with specific language like 'as a freelancer...' or 'for SaaS founders...' throughout."
- **No lead magnet info**: Email 1 defaults to a "welcome + what to expect" format rather than lead magnet delivery.
- **Request for 3 emails or fewer**: "A 3-email sequence is too short to build trust before the sell. I recommend at least 5. Want me to write a 5-email version?"

## Examples

**Example 1: Product + audience provided**
User: "Write an email sequence for HeyGen (my link: heygen.com/ref/abc123) targeting YouTube creators who opted in for my AI tools checklist."
Action: 7-email sequence, Day 0 delivers checklist, emails 2-3 teach AI video creation tips, emails 4-7 pitch HeyGen with creator-specific angles (save editing time, AI avatars, multilingual).

**Example 2: Chained from S1**
Context: S1 found Semrush with 30% recurring commission targeting SEO consultants.
User: "Now write an email sequence for this."
Action: Pull product details from S1 output. Write 7-email sequence targeting SEO consultants. Lead magnet assumed to be SEO-related content.

**Example 3: Minimal input**
User: "Write me a drip sequence for my Notion template affiliate program"
Action: Ask for affiliate URL and audience. Use Notion affiliate program knowledge for benefits. Write 5-email sequence (conservative default for shorter products with simpler buying journey).

## 25. Expert Skill: list-affitor-skill
> **Path within category:** `skills/meta/list-affitor-skill/SKILL.md`


# List Affitor Skill

Turn a repeatable AI prompt or workflow into a structured, publish-ready skill for
[list.affitor.com](https://list.affitor.com). The output is a complete SKILL.md file
that works in any AI agent — plus the listing fields to publish it on LIST.

## Stage

This skill belongs to Stage S8: Meta

## When to Use

- User has a prompt they keep reusing and wants to turn it into a shareable skill
- User wants to create a new skill for the Affitor skills directory
- User wants to write a SKILL.md file in the standard format
- User says "make this a skill" or "write a skill for X"
- User wants to package an AI workflow so others can replicate it

## Input Schema

```
{
  raw_prompt: string       # (required) The prompt, workflow description, or detailed explanation of what the skill does
  failure_modes: string    # (optional) What goes wrong when the output is bad — helps write better Instructions and Error Handling
  niche: string            # (optional) Category hint, e.g., "content", "research", "seo"
  examples: string         # (optional) Example input/output pairs the user already has
}
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand What the Prompt Actually Does

Before writing anything, analyze the user's raw prompt or workflow description:

1. **Task type** — Is this content creation, research, analysis, planning, automation, or something else?
2. **Variable inputs** — What changes each time? (product name, URL, audience, topic, etc.)
3. **Fixed structure** — What stays the same? (output format, sections, tone, constraints)
4. **Quality differentiator** — What makes a good output vs. a bad one?
5. **Failure modes** — Where does the AI tend to go wrong without explicit guidance?

If the user gave a vague description instead of an actual prompt, ask:
- "What do you typically paste into ChatGPT/Claude for this?"
- "What does the output look like when it works well?"
- "What goes wrong when it doesn't?"

If the user says "just do it", infer from context and proceed.

### Step 2: Determine Skill Metadata

Based on the analysis, determine:

| Field | How to decide |
|-------|--------------|
| `name` | Short, action-oriented. "Comparison Post Writer" not "A Skill for Writing Comparison Posts" |
| `slug` | kebab-case of name, e.g., `comparison-post-writer` |
| `category` | One of: research, content, seo, landing, distribution, analytics, automation, meta |
| `level` | beginner (1-step, no tools), intermediate (multi-step, 1 tool), advanced (complex workflow, multiple tools) |
| `stage` | S1-Research, S2-Content, S3-Blog, S4-Landing, S5-Distribution, S6-Analytics, S7-Automation, S8-Meta |
| `tags` | 3-6 lowercase tags relevant to the skill's domain |
| `tools` | What external tools the skill needs: `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `code_execution`, none |

### Step 3: Write the SKILL.md

Create a complete SKILL.md following this exact structure. Every section is required.

**Frontmatter (YAML)**
```yaml
```

**Title and Introduction**
One paragraph. What the skill does and what makes the output reliable. No marketing speak.

**When to Use**
3-5 specific trigger scenarios. "Writing a blog post" is too vague. "You need to publish a comparison post for two competing SaaS tools this week" is useful.

**Input Schema**
Typed definition of every variable input. Mark required vs optional.

**Workflow (numbered steps)**
This is the core. Each step must be concrete enough that any AI model produces consistent output:

- **Action** — what to do
- **Approach** — how to do it specifically
- **Quality bar** — what good looks like

Bad: "3. Write the pros and cons"
Good: "3. Write at least 3 pros and 2 cons. Each must reference a specific feature, not a vague category. 'Exports to 12 formats including PDF and DOCX' not 'Great export options'."

**Output Schema**
Typed fields that other skills can consume via conversation context. Include `output_schema_version: "1.0.0"`.

**Output Format**
A markdown code block showing the exact template with `[placeholder]` brackets. This is the single most important section for consistency.

**Error Handling**
3-5 named failure modes with specific recovery behavior. What happens when input is missing, ambiguous, or the task can't be completed?

**Examples**
2-3 concrete examples showing:
- User input
- Key decisions made during the workflow
- What the output looks like (excerpt, not full)

**Flywheel Connections**
- Feeds Into: which skills consume this skill's output
- Fed By: which skills produce input for this skill
- Feedback Loop: how community engagement improves the skill
- `chain_metadata` YAML block with `skill_slug`, `stage`, `timestamp`, `suggested_next`

**Quality Gate**
5-7 numbered checklist items that must all pass before the output is delivered. These are the self-validation checks the AI runs silently.

**References**
Links to supplementary reference files if applicable.

### Step 4: Write the LIST Description

Separately from the SKILL.md, write a community-facing description for the listing on list.affitor.com. This is what people see in the feed — it sells the skill, not documents it.

Structure:
1. **Opening** (2 sentences) — what the skill does, who it's for
2. **When to Use** (3 bullets) — specific scenarios
3. **What Makes It Different** (brief) — why this skill vs. just prompting
4. **Instructions summary** — condensed version of the workflow
5. **Input Required** — what the user needs to provide
6. **Output Format** — what the skill produces (show template)
7. **Example** — one concrete input/output
8. **Tips** (3-5) — practical advice for getting the best results

This is NOT the SKILL.md content — it's a human-friendly summary for discovery.

### Step 5: Assemble Output

Present two clearly separated outputs:

1. **SKILL.md** — the full file, ready to save to `skills/{stage}/{slug}/SKILL.md`
2. **LIST Submission** — listing fields + description for list.affitor.com

### Step 6: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] SKILL.md has all required sections (frontmatter, intro, when-to-use, input schema, workflow, output schema, output format, error handling, examples, flywheel, quality gate)
- [ ] Every workflow step has action + approach + quality bar
- [ ] Output Format uses a code block with `[placeholder]` brackets
- [ ] At least 2 examples with concrete input/output
- [ ] Error handling covers realistic failure modes, not hypothetical ones
- [ ] Quality gate items are testable (not "make sure it's good")
- [ ] Description is specific enough that someone knows if it's relevant before clicking
- [ ] Frontmatter `name` matches the slug exactly

## Output Schema

Other skills consume these fields from conversation context:

```
{
  output_schema_version: "1.0.0"
  skill_md: string           # Complete SKILL.md file content (ready to write to disk)
  listing: {
    name: string             # "Comparison Post Writer"
    slug: string             # "comparison-post-writer"
    description: string      # Community-facing description for list.affitor.com
    content: string          # Full SKILL.md content (for the content field)
    category: string         # "content", "research", "seo", etc.
    level: string            # "beginner", "intermediate", "advanced"
    tags: string[]           # ["content", "comparison", "seo", "blog"]
  }
  metadata: {
    stage: string            # "S2-Content"
    tools_needed: string[]   # ["web_search"] or []
    estimated_time: string   # "15 min"
  }
}
```

## Output Format

The skill produces two outputs:

### Output 1: SKILL.md File

## 26. Expert Skill: category-designer
> **Path within category:** `skills/meta/category-designer/SKILL.md`


# Category Designer

Define a new category where your recommended product wins by default. Instead of competing on existing criteria ("best AI video tool"), reframe the buying decision so your product IS the category ("the AI avatar platform for non-creators"). Category kings capture 76% of category economics — this is the strategic meta-skill that makes all downstream marketing easier.

## Stage

S8: Meta — This is cross-cutting strategic thinking, like `funnel-planner`. It operates above individual skills and reframes the entire marketing approach. Use it before creating content, offers, or landing pages.

## When to Use

- User is competing in a crowded market and needs to stand out
- User asks about "positioning", "category", "differentiation", "reframing"
- User says "category of one", "own a category", "change the game"
- After `monopoly-niche-finder` to formalize the niche into a named category
- After `purple-cow-audit` to amplify what makes a product remarkable
- Before creating content/offers to ensure consistent category messaging

## Input Schema

```yaml
product: object               # REQUIRED — the product to position
  name: string
  description: string
  key_features: string[]
  pricing: string
  current_category: string    # What category it's currently in
                              # e.g., "AI video tools", "email marketing platforms"

competitors: string[]         # OPTIONAL — main competitors
                              # Default: auto-researched

your_audience: string         # OPTIONAL — your specific audience
                              # Default: inferred from product

monopoly_niche: string        # OPTIONAL — from monopoly-niche-finder
                              # Default: none
```

**Chaining from S1 monopoly-niche-finder**: Use `monopoly_niche.intersection` as the starting point for category design.

**Chaining from S1 purple-cow-audit**: Use `remarkable_angles` to identify category-defining features.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Current Category

1. `web_search`: `"best [current_category]"` — see how the market is currently framed
2. Identify the default buying criteria (price, features, ease of use, etc.)
3. Map where the product wins AND loses on current criteria
4. Identify: what does this product do that competitors DON'T even try?

### Step 2: Find the Category Seed

The category seed is the intersection of:
- What the product does uniquely well
- What a specific audience cares about most
- What competitors ignore or can't do

Formula: `[Unique capability] + [Specific audience] + [Outcome they care about]`

Example: "AI avatar platform" + "for non-creators" + "who need professional video content"
= **"AI Video Content Platform for Non-Creators"**

### Step 3: Design the Category

Define:

1. **Category name** — 3-6 words, self-explanatory, memorable
2. **Category POV** — "The old way was [X]. The new way is [Y]. [Product] is the [category name]."
3. **Buying criteria** — new criteria where your product automatically wins
4. **Lightning strike** — the "aha moment" that makes the category real (a stat, story, or demonstration)
5. **Category ecosystem** — what other products/services exist in YOUR category (you define the landscape)

### Step 4: Create Category Assets

Produce:
1. **Category narrative** — 2-3 paragraph story of why this category exists now
2. **Comparison reframe** — how to redirect "Product X vs Product Y" to "Old category vs New category"
3. **Content angles** — 5-10 content pieces that educate the market about the category
4. **Objection handling** — "Isn't this just [old category]?" → "No, because..."

### Step 5: Self-Validation

- [ ] Category name is self-explanatory to someone hearing it for the first time
- [ ] Product genuinely wins on the new buying criteria (not forced)
- [ ] Category is big enough to matter but specific enough to own
- [ ] Narrative is compelling and truthful (not spin)
- [ ] Content angles are substantial enough for 6+ months of content

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"
category:
  name: string                  # The new category name
  pov: string                   # Point of view statement
  product_name: string
  old_category: string          # What it was before
  buying_criteria: string[]     # New criteria where product wins
  lightning_strike: string      # The "aha" proof point

  narrative: string             # Category story (2-3 paragraphs)
  comparison_reframe: string    # How to redirect comparisons

  content_angles: string[]     # Content pieces that establish the category
  objection_responses: object[] # Objection handling
    - objection: string
      response: string

  category_definition: string  # For chaining — the full category definition
  category_framing: string     # For chaining — positioning statement

chain_metadata:
  skill_slug: "category-designer"
  stage: "meta"
  timestamp: string
  suggested_next:
    - "grand-slam-offer"
    - "monopoly-niche-finder"
    - "affiliate-blog-builder"
    - "landing-page-creator"
```

## Output Format

```
## Category Design: [Category Name]

### The Shift
**Old category:** [what it was]
**New category:** [what it is now]
**Why now:** [why this category exists today]

### Category Definition
**[Category Name]:** [1 sentence definition]

### Point of View
"[The old way] was [X]. [The new way] is [Y]. [Product] is the [category name] that [outcome]."

### New Buying Criteria
When evaluating a [category name], look for:
1. [Criteria where your product wins]
2. [Criteria where your product wins]
3. [Criteria where your product wins]
(Note: [old criteria like "most features"] no longer matters because [reason])

### Lightning Strike
[The stat, story, or demo that makes the category undeniable]

### Category Narrative
[2-3 paragraphs telling the story of this category]

### Comparison Reframe
When someone asks "[Product] vs [Competitor]":
→ Reframe: "That's like comparing [new thing] to [old thing]. The question isn't [old criteria] — it's [new criteria]."

### Content Roadmap
1. "[Title]" — establishes the category problem
2. "[Title]" — introduces the new buying criteria
3. "[Title]" — showcases the product as category king
4. "[Title]" — data/proof that the new way works
5. "[Title]" — community/social proof

### Objection Handling
**"Isn't this just [old category]?"**
→ [Response]

**"Why should I care about a new category?"**
→ [Response]
```

## Error Handling

- **No product provided**: "Tell me the product and its current competitive landscape — I'll design a category it owns."
- **Product has no unique features**: "Every product has something. Let me dig deeper..." → focus on audience specificity rather than feature uniqueness.
- **Category too forced**: If the category feels artificial, recommend improving the product positioning within the existing category instead. Honesty > cleverness.
- **Too many competitors in proposed category**: Narrow the audience further or combine with `monopoly-niche-finder` for a tighter intersection.

## Examples

**Example 1:** "Design a category for HeyGen"
→ Old: "AI video tool." New: "AI Video Content Platform for Non-Creators." Buying criteria: no camera needed, no editing skills, no studio. Lightning strike: "84% of marketers say video is important, but only 15% make it regularly."

**Example 2:** "Position Semrush differently from Ahrefs"
→ Old: "SEO tool." New: "Revenue Intelligence Platform." Buying criteria: revenue attribution, not just rankings. Reframe: "Stop tracking keywords. Start tracking revenue."

**Example 3:** "Create a category for my niche" (after monopoly-niche-finder)
→ Take intersection niche, formalize into a named category with full narrative, buying criteria, and content roadmap.

## Revenue & Action Plan

### Expected Outcomes
- **Revenue potential**: Category kings capture 76% of category economics. If you define the category for your niche, your affiliate content becomes the default recommendation. Affiliates who "own" a category report 5-10x higher conversion rates because buyers see them as THE authority, not one of many
- **Benchmark**: Category-defining content gets 3x more organic search traffic because you rank for new keywords nobody else targets. You're not competing for "best AI video tool" — you're ranking for your own category name
- **Key metric to track**: Brand search volume (people searching YOUR category name or your brand + product) and affiliate conversion rate. Category owners see 5-8% conversion vs 1-2% for generic affiliates

### Do This Right Now (15 min)
1. **Publish your first category-defining content piece** — use Content Angle #1 from the Content Roadmap
2. **Update your social bios** to include the category name (e.g., "Helping non-creators make professional videos | AI Video Content for Non-Creators")
3. **Update your landing page hero** with the Category POV statement
4. **Start using the category name consistently** in all content — repetition creates recognition

### Track Your Results
After 90 days: are people using your category name in conversations, searches, or social posts? After 6 months: has your affiliate conversion rate increased vs before category positioning? Category design is a long game — it compounds over months, not days.

> **Next step — copy-paste this prompt:**
> "Build an irresistible offer for [product] using this category positioning: [category POV]" → runs `grand-slam-offer`

## 27. Expert Skill: self-improver
> **Path within category:** `skills/meta/self-improver/SKILL.md`


# Self-Improver

Review affiliate campaign results, diagnose what worked and what didn't, and generate a prioritized improvement plan. Uses affiliate-specific diagnostic frameworks (offer-market fit, traffic-content match, funnel leak analysis) to identify root causes and actionable fixes.

## Stage

S8: Meta — Most affiliates repeat the same mistakes because they never do structured retrospectives. Self-Improver closes the feedback loop: it takes your results, compares them to expectations, diagnoses gaps using affiliate-specific frameworks, and produces concrete actions that feed back into S1-S7 for the next iteration.

## When to Use

- User has run a campaign and wants to understand results
- User's affiliate content isn't converting and wants to diagnose why
- User wants to compare actual vs expected results
- User says "what went wrong?", "why no conversions?", "how to improve?"
- User wants a structured retrospective on their affiliate efforts
- Chaining from S6.3 (performance-report) — analyze the data and plan improvements

## Input Schema

```yaml
campaign:
  description: string          # REQUIRED — what was done (e.g., "Published 3 blog reviews
                               # of AI video tools, shared on LinkedIn and Reddit")
  duration: string             # OPTIONAL — how long (e.g., "2 weeks", "1 month")
  skills_used: string[]        # OPTIONAL — which Affitor skills were used
  channels: string[]           # OPTIONAL — where content was distributed

results:
  clicks: number               # OPTIONAL — total clicks on affiliate links
  conversions: number          # OPTIONAL — total signups/purchases
  revenue: number              # OPTIONAL — total commission earned
  traffic: number              # OPTIONAL — total page views / impressions
  feedback: string             # OPTIONAL — qualitative feedback received

expectations:
  expected_clicks: number      # OPTIONAL — what was expected
  expected_conversions: number # OPTIONAL
  expected_revenue: number     # OPTIONAL
  benchmark: string            # OPTIONAL — "industry average" or specific number

context:
  niche: string                # OPTIONAL — product category
  experience: string           # OPTIONAL — "first campaign" | "experienced"
  budget: string               # OPTIONAL — money spent (if any)
```

**Chaining context**: If S6.3 (performance-report) was run in the same conversation, pull KPIs directly. If S1-S5 outputs exist in context, reference them for gap analysis.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Establish Baseline

Collect campaign description and results. If numbers are missing, work with whatever is available. State assumptions clearly: "You didn't share click data, so I'll focus on qualitative analysis."

### Step 2: Compare Results vs Expectations

Calculate gaps:
- **Traffic gap**: Expected vs actual impressions/visits
- **Click gap**: Expected vs actual CTR
- **Conversion gap**: Expected vs actual conversion rate
- **Revenue gap**: Expected vs actual earnings

Use industry benchmarks if user doesn't have expectations:
- Affiliate blog CTR: 2-5%
- Affiliate conversion rate: 1-3%
- Social post engagement: 1-3% of impressions
- Email click rate: 2-5%

### Step 3: Diagnose Root Causes

Apply affiliate-specific diagnostic frameworks:

**Offer-Market Fit**: Is the product right for the audience?
- Wrong audience for the product
- Product too expensive for the audience's budget
- Product solves a problem the audience doesn't have

**Traffic-Content Match**: Is the traffic source aligned with the content?
- Blog content promoted on TikTok (format mismatch)
- Reddit post that reads like an ad (platform mismatch)
- Cold traffic sent to a hard sell (temperature mismatch)

**Funnel Leaks**: Where do people drop off?
- High impressions but low clicks → weak headline/hook
- High clicks but low conversions → landing page or product issue
- High conversions but low revenue → wrong product (low commission)

### Step 4: Prioritize Improvements

Rank each improvement by:
- **Impact**: How much would this change move the needle? (1-5)
- **Effort**: How hard is it to implement? (1-5)
- **Priority**: Impact / Effort ratio

### Step 5: Create Iteration Plan

For each top improvement, specify:
- What to change
- Which Affitor skill to re-run
- Exact prompt modification for better results
- Expected improvement (realistic estimate)

### Step 6: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] Gap calculations accurate: expected minus actual
- [ ] Root causes are evidence-based, not speculation
- [ ] Impact (1-5) and effort (1-5) scores are justified with reasoning
- [ ] Next steps reference specific Affitor skills by name
- [ ] Iteration plan has concrete timeline and measurable success metric

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
retrospective:
  campaign: string
  period: string
  overall_assessment: string   # "strong" | "average" | "needs_work" | "failing"

gaps:
  - metric: string             # e.g., "conversion_rate"
    expected: string
    actual: string
    gap: string                # e.g., "-2.5%"

diagnosis:
  root_causes:
    - cause: string            # e.g., "Traffic-content mismatch"
      evidence: string         # what indicates this
      severity: string         # "high" | "medium" | "low"

improvements:
  - action: string             # what to do
    skill: string              # which Affitor skill to use
    prompt: string             # exact prompt for the skill
    impact: number             # 1-5
    effort: number             # 1-5
    priority: number           # impact / effort

iteration_plan:
  next_steps: string[]         # ordered list of actions
  timeline: string             # e.g., "1 week"
  success_metric: string       # how to measure improvement
```

## Output Format

1. **Campaign Summary** — what was done, results achieved
2. **Gap Analysis** — table comparing expected vs actual metrics
3. **Root Cause Diagnosis** — what's causing the gaps, with evidence
4. **Improvement Actions** — prioritized table with action, skill, impact, effort
5. **Next Iteration Plan** — ordered steps with timeline and success metrics

## Error Handling

- **No results data at all**: "I need at least one data point to diagnose. Do you have: clicks, conversions, revenue, or even qualitative feedback (comments, reactions)? Even 'I got zero conversions' is useful data."
- **Only qualitative data**: Shift to qualitative analysis. "Without numbers, I'll focus on content quality, offer fit, and platform alignment. Here's what I can diagnose from your description."
- **Unrealistic expectations**: "You expected 100 sales from a single blog post in week 1. Industry average conversion rate is 1-3%, so 100 sales would require 3,000-10,000 clicks. Let me recalibrate your expectations and plan from there."

## Examples

### Example 1: Blog campaign with low conversions

**User**: "I wrote 3 blog reviews of AI tools last month. Got 2,000 visitors but only 2 conversions ($14 total). What went wrong?"
**Action**: Conversion rate 0.1% vs benchmark 1-3%. Diagnose: possible funnel leak (weak CTAs? disclosure too prominent? wrong products for audience?). Check traffic sources (SEO cold traffic needs more warming). Recommend: S6 (ab-test-generator) on CTAs, S6 (seo-audit) on content quality, S4 (landing-page-creator) as intermediate step.

### Example 2: Social campaign with zero clicks

**User**: "Posted 10 LinkedIn posts about Semrush. Lots of likes but nobody clicked my link."
**Action**: Traffic-content mismatch. LinkedIn engagement ≠ clicks. Diagnose: link placement (probably in comments where nobody looks), content may be too educational without clear CTA, audience may not be in buying mode on LinkedIn. Recommend: S2 (viral-post-writer) with CTA-focused brief, S3 (affiliate-blog-builder) to create destination content, S7 (content-repurposer) to adapt for click-friendly platforms.

### Example 3: Chained from performance-report

**Context**: S6.3 performance-report shows EPC of $0.02 across 5 programs, with one program at $0.15 EPC.
**User**: "How do I improve these numbers?"
**Action**: One program is 7x more profitable. Diagnose: concentrate effort on the winner. For the four underperformers, check offer-market fit (are these the wrong products?). Recommend: S7 (multi-program-manager) to restructure portfolio, S7 (content-repurposer) to create more content for the winning program, S6 (ab-test-generator) to optimize existing content.

## 28. Expert Skill: funnel-planner
> **Path within category:** `skills/meta/funnel-planner/SKILL.md`


# Funnel Planner

Plan a complete affiliate funnel from research to revenue by chaining Affitor skills into a week-by-week execution roadmap. Output is a Markdown plan with skill sequence, time estimates, and exact invocation prompts for each step.

## Stage

S8: Meta — Most affiliates fail because they skip steps or work out of order. Funnel Planner solves this by mapping the user's resources (time, channels, experience) to a personalized execution plan that chains S1-S7 skills in the right sequence. It's the onboarding wizard for affiliate marketing via AI agent.

## When to Use

- User is starting from scratch and wants a complete plan
- User asks "how do I start affiliate marketing?"
- User has a niche but no strategy
- User wants to know which skills to use and in what order
- User says "build me a funnel" or "plan my affiliate business"
- User wants a week-by-week roadmap
- Chaining: this skill recommends which other skills to run and in what order

## Input Schema

```yaml
niche: string                  # OPTIONAL — e.g., "AI tools", "fitness supplements"
                               # If not provided, S1 research will help identify one

product: string                # OPTIONAL — specific product if already chosen
                               # e.g., "HeyGen" or "Semrush"

experience_level: string       # OPTIONAL — "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced"
                               # Default: "beginner"

available_channels:            # OPTIONAL — platforms the user can use
  - string                     # e.g., ["blog", "twitter", "linkedin", "email"]
                               # Default: ["blog", "twitter"]

weekly_hours: number           # OPTIONAL — hours per week available
                               # Default: 5

goal: string                   # OPTIONAL — "first_commission" | "scale_to_1k" | "scale_to_10k"
                               # Default: "first_commission"
```

**Chaining context**: If S1 was run earlier, pull niche and product info from conversation. If the user has mentioned their channels or experience, use that context.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Assess Starting Point

Determine where the user is:
- **Has nothing**: Start from S1 (full funnel)
- **Has a product**: Skip S1, start from S2
- **Has content**: Skip S1-S2, start from S3 or S4
- **Has traffic**: Skip to S6 (analytics) or S7 (automation)

Ask clarifying questions only if truly ambiguous. Default to the most common case (beginner, starting from scratch).

### Step 2: Select Relevant Skills

Based on channels, experience, and goal, select 5-8 skills from S1-S7:
- **Beginner + blog + twitter**: S1 → S2 (viral-post-writer) → S3 (affiliate-blog-builder) → S5 (bio-link-deployer) → S6 (seo-audit)
- **Intermediate + email + blog**: S1 → S3 → S4 (landing-page-creator) → S5 (email-drip-sequence) → S6 (performance-report) → S7 (content-repurposer)
- **Advanced + all channels**: Full S1-S7 pipeline with S8 (compliance-checker) at each content step

### Step 3: Estimate Effort

For each selected skill, estimate time based on experience level:
- Beginner: 2-4 hours per skill
- Intermediate: 1-2 hours per skill
- Advanced: 30-60 minutes per skill

Fit into the user's `weekly_hours` to create a week-by-week schedule.

### Step 4: Create Roadmap

Build a week-by-week table:
- Week number
- Skill to run
- What it produces
- Time estimate
- Exact prompt to invoke the skill

### Step 5: Add Success Metrics

For each phase, define measurable outcomes:
- S1: "You should have 2-3 programs selected"
- S2: "You should have 5+ social posts ready"
- S3: "You should have 1-2 blog posts published"
- S5: "You should have a bio link page live"
- S6: "You should know your EPC and conversion rate"

### Step 6: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] Roadmap follows logical sequence (S1→S2→S3... not random order)
- [ ] Invocation prompts are copy-paste ready for each skill
- [ ] Time estimates realistic for stated experience level
- [ ] Success metrics are measurable and specific (not "do well")
- [ ] Total weeks feasible given user's weekly hours budget

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
plan:
  niche: string
  product: string
  experience: string
  goal: string
  total_weeks: number
  total_skills: number

roadmap:
  - week: number
    skill: string              # skill slug
    stage: string              # e.g., "S1: Research"
    action: string             # what to do this week
    time_estimate: string      # e.g., "2-3 hours"
    invocation_prompt: string  # exact prompt to give your AI agent
    success_metric: string     # how to know this step is done

milestones:
  - week: number
    name: string               # e.g., "First content published"
    description: string
```

## Output Format

1. **Plan Overview** — niche, goal, timeline, total skills
2. **Week-by-Week Roadmap** — table with week, skill, action, time, and prompt
3. **Milestones** — key checkpoints with expected outcomes
4. **Entry Points** — where to jump in if user is not starting from scratch

## Error Handling

- **No niche or product**: "Let's find your niche first. I'll plan a funnel that starts with S1 (affiliate-program-search) to discover the best programs for you. What topics interest you? (e.g., AI tools, fitness, finance)"
- **Unrealistic time commitment ("1 hour total")**: "Building a profitable affiliate funnel takes sustained effort. With 1 hour/week, I'd focus on one channel. Here's a minimal plan using just S1 + S2 (social posts only)."
- **Too many channels for experience level**: "You listed 6 channels but you're a beginner. I'd recommend starting with 2 (blog + one social platform) and adding more after your first commission."

## Examples

### Example 1: Complete beginner

**User**: "I want to start affiliate marketing. I have 5 hours a week and I blog."
**Action**: Plan a 6-week funnel: Week 1 S1 (find programs) → Week 2 S2 (write social posts) → Week 3-4 S3 (write blog review) → Week 5 S5 (bio link page) → Week 6 S6 (SEO audit + tracking). Include exact prompts for each skill.

### Example 2: Intermediate with product

**User**: "I already promote Semrush. How do I scale to $1K/month?"
**Action**: Skip S1. Plan around optimization: S6 (performance-report to baseline) → S6 (ab-test-generator for existing content) → S7 (content-repurposer to multiply what works) → S7 (email-automation-builder for nurture) → S6 (performance-report again to measure).

### Example 3: Advanced multi-channel

**User**: "I'm an experienced affiliate with blog, YouTube, and email. Plan me a full funnel for AI tools."
**Action**: Compressed 4-week plan using all stages. Week 1: S1 (research) + S2 (content blitz). Week 2: S3 (blog) + S4 (landing page). Week 3: S5 (distribution) + S7 (content-repurposer). Week 4: S6 (analytics setup) + S8 (compliance-checker). Ongoing: S8 (self-improver) monthly.

## 29. Expert Skill: compliance-checker
> **Path within category:** `skills/meta/compliance-checker/SKILL.md`


# Compliance Checker

Audit affiliate content for FTC compliance, platform-specific rules, and legal requirements. Checks disclosure placement, prohibited claims, endorsement guidelines, and platform policies. Output is a compliance scorecard with issues, severity, and fix suggestions.

## Stage

S8: Meta — The FTC has fined affiliates $4.2M+ for undisclosed endorsements. One missing disclosure can result in legal action, platform bans, or program termination. This skill is the safety net — run it on any content before publishing to catch compliance issues before they become problems.

## When to Use

- User wants to check content before publishing
- User asks about FTC rules or affiliate disclosure requirements
- User is unsure if their content is compliant
- User says "is this legal?", "do I need a disclosure?", "check my post"
- User is preparing content for a platform with strict ad policies (Facebook, Google)
- Chaining: run after any S2-S5 or S7 content-producing skill before publishing
- User wants to audit existing published content

## Input Schema

```yaml
content: string                # REQUIRED — the content to check (text, markdown, or HTML)

content_type: string           # REQUIRED — "social_post" | "blog" | "landing_page"
                               # | "email" | "ad" | "video_script"

platform: string               # OPTIONAL — "linkedin" | "twitter" | "reddit" | "facebook"
                               # | "tiktok" | "youtube" | "google_ads" | "pinterest"
                               # Platform-specific rules applied if provided

claims:                        # OPTIONAL — specific claims to verify
  - string                     # e.g., ["earn $10K/month", "guaranteed results"]
```

**Chaining context**: If content was produced by S2-S5 or S7 in the same conversation, pull it directly. The user should not have to paste content that was just generated.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Detect Affiliate Links

Scan content for:
- URLs with affiliate parameters (`ref=`, `aff=`, `partner=`, UTM tags)
- Shortened URLs (bit.ly, etc.) that may hide affiliate links
- Product mentions that imply a commercial relationship

### Step 2: Check FTC Disclosure

Read `shared/references/ftc-compliance.md` for rules. Check:
- **Presence**: Is there a disclosure? (required if any affiliate link exists)
- **Placement**: Is the disclosure before or near the affiliate link? (not buried at the bottom)
- **Clarity**: Is it clear to a reasonable consumer? ("affiliate link" is clear; "partner" alone is not)
- **Format by content type**:
  - Social post: `#ad` or `Affiliate link` visible without expanding
  - Blog: Disclosure in the opening paragraph, above the fold
  - Landing page: Medium disclosure above the fold
  - Email: Disclosure near the affiliate link
  - Ad: Platform-specific requirements

### Step 3: Check Prohibited Claims

Scan for:
- **Income claims**: "earn $X", "make money fast", "passive income guaranteed"
- **False urgency**: "only 3 left" (if not verifiable), "offer expires" (if no real deadline)
- **Health/medical claims**: unsubstantiated health benefits
- **Guaranteed results**: "guaranteed to work", "100% success rate"
- **Fake scarcity**: "limited spots" (if not actually limited)
- **Fake testimonials**: results that aren't typical without disclaimer

### Step 4: Check Platform Rules

If `platform` is provided, apply platform-specific rules:
- **Reddit**: Self-promotion rules (10:1 ratio), must disclose in post
- **Facebook/Instagram**: Branded Content tool, "Paid Partnership" label for ads
- **Google Ads**: Clear commercial intent, no misleading claims, landing page requirements
- **TikTok**: #ad or Paid Partnership toggle, no medical/financial advice claims
- **YouTube**: Verbal + written disclosure in first 30 seconds, "Includes paid promotion" checkbox

### Step 5: Score and Report

Rate compliance on three levels:
- **PASS**: No issues found
- **WARN**: Minor issues that should be fixed (e.g., disclosure placement could be better)
- **FAIL**: Critical issues that must be fixed before publishing (e.g., no disclosure at all)

### Step 6: Generate Fixes

For each issue, provide:
- What's wrong (specific quote from content)
- Why it matters (rule reference)
- How to fix it (specific replacement text)

### Step 7: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] All affiliate links in the content are detected and flagged
- [ ] Disclosure placement check matches platform-specific rules
- [ ] Prohibited claims identified with exact quotes from content
- [ ] Fix suggestions are copy-paste ready and preserve original tone
- [ ] Corrected content would pass a re-scan by this same skill

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

  disclosure_placement: string # "correct" | "needs_improvement" | "missing"
  prohibited_claims: number    # count of issues found
  platform_issues: number      # count of platform-specific issues

issues:
  - severity: string          # "critical" | "warning" | "info"

    fix: string               # suggested replacement

corrected_content: string      # full content with all fixes applied
```

## Output Format

1. **Compliance Scorecard** — overall score, disclosure status, issue counts
2. **Issues Found** — table with severity, category, description, and fix
3. **Corrected Content** — the full content with all issues fixed (copy-paste ready)
4. **Platform Notes** — any platform-specific requirements not yet addressed

## Error Handling

- **No content provided**: "Paste the content you want me to check, or tell me which skill output to review. I'll check it for FTC compliance and platform rules."
- **Content has no affiliate links**: "No affiliate links detected. FTC disclosure is only required for content with material connections (affiliate links, sponsored content, gifted products). Your content looks clean."
- **Unknown platform**: "I don't have specific rules for [platform]. I'll check general FTC compliance. For platform-specific rules, check the platform's advertising policy page."

## Examples

### Example 1: Social post with missing disclosure

**User**: "Check this tweet: 'Just tried HeyGen and it's incredible for creating AI videos. Use my link to get 10% off: heygen.com/ref/abc123'"
**Action**: FAIL — no FTC disclosure. Fix: Add `#ad` before or after the link. Output corrected tweet with disclosure.

### Example 2: Blog post with buried disclosure

**User**: [Pastes a 1000-word blog review with disclosure only in the footer]
**Action**: WARN — disclosure present but buried at bottom. Fix: Move disclosure to opening paragraph. Also check for income claims, link attributes (`rel="nofollow sponsored"`).

### Example 3: Facebook ad with income claim

**User**: "Check this ad: 'I made $5,000 last month with this one tool. You can too! Click here to start earning.'"
**Action**: FAIL — (1) income claim without typicality disclaimer, (2) no FTC disclosure, (3) Facebook requires Paid Partnership label. Output fixes for all three issues.

## Revenue & Action Plan

### Expected Outcomes
- **Revenue protection**: The FTC has fined affiliates $4.2M+ for undisclosed endorsements. A single violation can result in program termination (losing ALL commissions), platform bans, or legal action. Compliance isn't about making money — it's about not losing the money you've already earned
- **Benchmark**: Amazon Associates terminates 10,000+ affiliate accounts per year for policy violations. One missing disclosure on one post can end your entire affiliate business overnight
- **Key metric to track**: Compliance score across ALL your published content. Target: 100% PASS. Any FAIL = fix before publishing. Any WARN = fix within 48 hours

### Do This Right Now (15 min)
1. **Fix all FAIL issues immediately** — do not publish until every critical issue is resolved
2. **Fix WARN issues** — update disclosure placement, fix any claim language
3. **Copy the Corrected Content** from the output and replace your original content
4. **Audit your top 5 existing posts** — run this skill on your most-trafficked affiliate content to ensure they're compliant

### Track Your Results
Run this skill monthly on all new content before publishing. Keep a compliance log — if the same issue appears 3+ times, update your content creation workflow to prevent it at the source (e.g., add FTC disclosure to your post template).

> **Next step — copy-paste this prompt:**
> "Plan my entire affiliate funnel from research to revenue" → runs `funnel-planner`

## 30. Expert Skill: skill-finder
> **Path within category:** `skills/meta/skill-finder/SKILL.md`


# Skill Finder

Search and discover Affitor skills by task, stage, keyword, or natural language goal. Returns a ranked list of matching skills with descriptions, input requirements, and recommended next steps. Output is a concise Markdown guide.

## Stage

S8: Meta — The entry point to the entire Affitor ecosystem. New users don't know what's available. Experienced users forget skill names. Skill Finder bridges the gap — it reads the registry, matches intent to capability, and recommends the fastest path to the user's goal.

## When to Use

- User is new to Affitor and asks "what can I do?" or "where do I start?"
- User describes a goal but doesn't name a specific skill
- User wants to find skills by stage (e.g., "what analytics skills exist?")
- User asks "which skill helps with [topic]?"
- User says anything like "find skill", "search skill", "explore skills"
- Chaining: recommended as the first skill for new users before S1-S7

## Input Schema

```yaml
query: string                  # REQUIRED — natural language: "I want to write a blog review"
                               # or "what skills help with SEO?" or "analytics skills"
stage_filter: string           # OPTIONAL — filter by stage: research | content | blog | landing
                               # | distribution | analytics | automation | meta
goal: string                   # OPTIONAL — broader goal: "first commission" | "scale to 1k"
                               # | "optimize conversions" | "automate my workflow"
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Skill Catalog

Read `registry.json` from the repository root (or from conversation context if already loaded). Parse all skills with their stage, name, slug, and description.

### Step 2: Match Query to Skills

Match the user's `query` against:
1. Skill names and slugs (exact match → top priority)
2. Skill descriptions (keyword overlap)
3. Stage labels and descriptions (if user is browsing by stage)
4. Inferred intent (e.g., "SEO" → `seo-audit`, `affiliate-blog-builder`)

If `stage_filter` is provided, restrict results to that stage.

### Step 3: Rank Results

Rank matches by relevance:
1. Direct name/slug match
2. Description keyword match count
3. Stage alignment with user's apparent funnel position

### Step 4: Recommend a Path

If the user's goal spans multiple stages, suggest a skill sequence:
- "You want to go from zero to first commission → S1 → S2 → S3 → S5"
- "You want to optimize existing content → S6 (seo-audit, ab-test-generator)"

### Step 5: Output Results

Present top 3-5 matching skills with:
- Skill name and stage
- What it does (one sentence)
- What input it needs
- Example invocation prompt

### Step 6: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] All matched skills exist in the current registry
- [ ] Example prompts are copy-paste ready and grammatically correct
- [ ] Recommended path follows logical funnel sequence
- [ ] Relevance ranking: exact match > partial match > related
- [ ] Input needed descriptions match actual skill Input Schemas

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
matches:
  - skill: string              # skill slug
    stage: string              # e.g., "S6: Analytics"
    description: string        # one-sentence summary
    input_needed: string       # what the user needs to provide
    example_prompt: string     # copy-paste prompt to invoke the skill
    relevance: string          # "exact" | "high" | "related"

recommended_path:
  description: string          # why this path
  steps:
    - order: number
      skill: string
      action: string           # what this step accomplishes
```

## Output Format

1. **Matching Skills** — table with skill name, stage, description, and relevance
2. **How to Use** — for each top match, show the exact prompt to invoke it
3. **Recommended Path** — if the goal spans multiple stages, a numbered sequence

## Error Handling

- **Empty query**: "What are you trying to accomplish? For example: 'write a blog review', 'track conversions', or 'plan a full funnel'."
- **No matches found**: "No skills match '[query]'. Here are all available stages: [list stages]. Try describing your goal differently."
- **Too broad query ("everything")**: Show one skill per stage as a sampler, then ask: "Which stage interests you most?"

## Examples

### Example 1: Specific task query

**User**: "I want to write a blog review of an AI tool"
**Action**: Match → `affiliate-blog-builder` (S3, exact), `comparison-post-writer` (S3, related), `viral-post-writer` (S2, related). Show top 3 with example prompts. Recommend: "Start with S1 `affiliate-program-search` to find the best program, then use S3 `affiliate-blog-builder` for the review."

### Example 2: Stage browsing

**User**: "What analytics skills are available?"
**Action**: Filter by `analytics` stage → show all 4: `conversion-tracker`, `ab-test-generator`, `performance-report`, `seo-audit`. Describe each with input requirements.

### Example 3: Goal-oriented

**User**: "I'm new to affiliate marketing, where do I start?"
**Action**: Recommend the beginner path: S1 (`affiliate-program-search`) → S2 (`viral-post-writer`) → S3 (`affiliate-blog-builder`) → S5 (`bio-link-deployer`). Explain each step in one sentence.

- `shared/references/flywheel-connections.md` — master flywheel connection map

## Revenue & Action Plan

### Expected Outcomes
- **Revenue potential**: The fastest path to your first commission is using the right skill at the right time. Skill Finder saves you hours of guessing — it matches your current situation to the exact workflow that generates revenue. Affiliates who follow a structured skill sequence report 3x faster time-to-first-commission
- **Benchmark**: The typical path to first commission: S1 (find product, 30 min) → S2 (create content, 1 hour) → S5 (distribute, 30 min) = first affiliate link live in 2 hours. First commission typically arrives within 7-14 days
- **Key metric to track**: Time-to-first-commission. How long from "I started" to "I earned my first dollar"? Use `performance-report` to track ongoing revenue

### Do This Right Now (15 min)
1. **Copy the first recommended prompt** from the Recommended Path section and run it immediately
2. **Don't skip steps** — the recommended path is ordered for a reason. S1 before S2, S2 before S5
3. **Set a goal**: earn your first commission within 14 days by running one skill per day
4. **Bookmark this skill** — come back whenever you're unsure what to do next

### Track Your Results
After running 3-5 skills in sequence: do you have a live affiliate link? Is it getting clicks? If yes, you're on the path. If no, re-run Skill Finder with a more specific goal ("I have a blog but no traffic" vs "I'm starting from zero").

> **Next step — run the first skill in your Recommended Path!**

## 31. Expert Skill: reddit-post-writer
> **Path within category:** `skills/content/reddit-post-writer/SKILL.md`


# Reddit Post Writer

Write Reddit posts and comments that earn upvotes by leading with genuine value.
The affiliate recommendation comes second — after trust is built. Reddit users
have a finely tuned spam detector. This skill helps affiliates write like Redditors,
not marketers.

## Stage

This skill belongs to Stage S2: Content

## When to Use

- User wants to drive affiliate traffic from Reddit
- User wants to recommend a product in a relevant subreddit
- User is active in a community and wants to add a helpful product mention
- User has a genuine experience with a product and wants to share it naturally
- User asks how to participate on Reddit without getting banned for self-promotion

## Input Schema

```
{
  product: {
    name: string              # (required) "Notion"
    description: string       # (optional) What the product does
    url: string               # (optional) Affiliate link — used in disclosure only
    reward_value: string      # (optional) Commission — never revealed in post
  }
  subreddit: string           # (optional) Target subreddit, e.g., "r/productivity"
  post_type: string           # (optional, default: auto) "post" | "comment_reply" | "ama_style"
  trigger_question: string    # (optional) Specific Reddit question or post you're replying to
  personal_experience: string # (optional) Real experience with the product to use as anchor
  audience: string            # (optional) Who reads this subreddit — "students", "developers"
  tone: string                # (optional, default: "genuine") "genuine" | "analytical" | "casual"
  problem_focus: string       # (optional) The specific problem this post addresses
}
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Reddit Culture First

Before writing, confirm the target subreddit context. If subreddit is provided,
use `web_search "reddit r/[subreddit] rules affiliate"` to check:
- Are affiliate links explicitly banned? (many subreddits ban them outright)
- What post formats are most common? (links, text posts, discussions)
- What gets upvoted vs. downvoted in this community?
- Is there a community expectation of neutrality or personal experience?

**Subreddits that generally tolerate product mentions:**
r/productivity, r/entrepreneur, r/Entrepreneur, r/sidehustle, r/personalfinance,
r/freelance, r/marketing, r/SEO, r/webdev, r/startups, r/smallbusiness

**Subreddits that are extremely ban-happy about promotion:**
r/frugal, r/cscareerquestions, r/AskReddit, r/personalfinance (strict on direct links)

If subreddit bans affiliate links: do NOT write a post with a link. Instead, write
a post that mentions the product by name with a note like "Search for [product]
affiliate program if interested." Disclose and redirect.

### Step 2: Determine the Post Type

**Option A — Original Post (new thread):**
Best when there's no existing discussion. Write a story, question, or breakdown that
organically leads to a product mention.
- "How I went from X to Y — the exact tools I used"
- "Anyone else use [product] for [use case]? Here's my 6-month review"
- "I tested 5 [category] tools so you don't have to — honest breakdown"

**Option B — Comment Reply (responding to an existing post):**
Highest trust format. Someone asks "what tool do you use for X?" and you reply helpfully.
- Write a substantive answer that doesn't mention the product until the 3rd+ paragraph
- Add value even without the product mention — if removed, the comment should still be helpful
- Product mention: "Personally, I use [product] and it's been solid for [specific use case]"

**Option C — AMA-Style / Experience Share:**
"I've been doing [X] for [N] years. Happy to share what's worked."
- Opens conversation, positions creator as authority
- Product naturally comes up when people ask "what tools do you use?"

If `trigger_question` is provided → use Option B. Otherwise, default to Option A.

### Step 3: Research Product and Find Reddit-Specific Angles

Use `web_search "reddit [product name] review"` to find:
- What real Reddit users are saying about the product (use their language)
- Common objections raised on Reddit (address these proactively)
- How competitors are discussed (context for framing)
- Questions people ask that your post can answer

Also use `web_search "reddit [problem space] best tools"` to understand:
- What alternatives Redditors currently recommend
- How to frame your recommendation as additive, not replacing their preferences
- What not to say (phrases that get downvoted in this community)

### Step 4: Write the Post

**Reddit post structure that converts:**

1. **Title** (for new posts): specific, searchable, sounds like a real person's question or story
   - Good: "I tried 4 project management tools over 2 years — here's what I actually use now"
   - Bad: "The BEST productivity tool I've ever used!! (link in post)"
   - Good: "[6 months update] How I finally stopped context-switching between apps"

2. **Opening paragraph**: establish credibility or relatability. NO product mention here.
   - "I've been freelancing for 3 years and I'm embarrassed by how long I tried to manage
     everything in spreadsheets."

3. **Body**: share the actual useful content — your experience, the problem, what you tried.
   This section should be valuable even without the product mention.

4. **Product introduction** (70-80% through the post): introduce naturally.
   - "Eventually I landed on [product] and I've stuck with it for [X months]."
   - Specific use case: what exactly you use it for, not vague praise
   - ONE honest con: "It's not perfect — the mobile app is weak — but for desktop work
     it's exactly what I needed." Cons dramatically increase trust.

5. **FTC disclosure** (at the bottom):
   - "Full disclosure: the link in my profile leads to an affiliate link. No extra cost
     to you, and I would recommend this tool regardless."
   - Or if not posting a link: "Not affiliated, just a genuine fan."
   - Per `shared/references/ftc-compliance.md` — disclosure is required for Reddit too.

6. **Closing**: invite discussion, not clicks.
   - "Happy to answer questions about my workflow in the comments."
   - Ask a question back: "What does your current setup look like?"

### Step 5: Anti-Spam Checklist

Before finalizing, run through this checklist:

- [ ] Post adds value even if the product mention is removed
- [ ] No exclamation marks in praise ("This tool is AMAZING!!")
- [ ] No superlatives without evidence ("best tool I've ever used" → needs qualifier)
- [ ] Affiliate link goes in comments or profile bio, NOT the main post body (most subreddits)
- [ ] FTC disclosure is present and clear
- [ ] Post doesn't read like a press release
- [ ] Includes at least one real limitation or caveat about the product
- [ ] Tone matches the subreddit (match voice to community)
- [ ] Username context matters — new accounts posting affiliate content get instant downvotes

### Step 6: Add Engagement Strategy

Reddit rewards participation, not broadcasting. Include:
1. **Reply strategy**: when commenters respond, how to keep conversation going naturally
2. **Upvote path**: what type of engagement to solicit (awards, saves, discussion)
3. **Subreddit timing**: best day/time to post in this subreddit
4. **Cross-post candidates**: which other subreddits this post could work in

### Step 7: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] Post adds value even if product mention is removed
- [ ] No exclamation marks in product praise
- [ ] Affiliate link in comments or bio, NOT in post body
- [ ] FTC "Full disclosure: affiliate link" present at bottom
- [ ] At least one real product limitation or caveat mentioned
- [ ] Tone matches target subreddit style

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

  output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes

## 32. Expert Skill: viral-post-writer
> **Path within category:** `skills/content/viral-post-writer/SKILL.md`


# Viral Post Writer

Write high-converting social media posts that promote affiliate products without feeling salesy. Each post uses proven viral frameworks, is tailored to the target platform, and includes proper FTC disclosure.

## Stage

This skill belongs to Stage S2: Content

## When to Use

- User wants to promote an affiliate product on social media
- User asks for LinkedIn posts, X/Twitter threads, Reddit posts, or Facebook posts
- User has picked a program (from S1 or manually) and needs content
- User wants "viral" or "engaging" social media content for affiliate marketing
- User asks how to naturally promote a product on a specific platform

## Input Schema

```
{
  product: {                  # (required) Product to promote — from S1 output or user-provided
    name: string              # "HeyGen"
    description: string       # What the product does (1-2 sentences)
    reward_value: string      # "30%" (for context — never shown in post)
    url: string               # Product website or affiliate link
  }
  platform: string            # (required) "linkedin" | "x" | "reddit" | "facebook" | "all"
  angle: string               # (optional, default: auto-selected) Content angle — see Viral Frameworks
  tone: string                # (optional, default: "conversational") "conversational" | "professional" | "casual" | "storytelling"
  audience: string            # (optional, default: inferred from platform) Target audience description
  personal_experience: string # (optional) User's real experience with the product — makes content authentic
  cta_style: string           # (optional, default: "soft") "soft" | "direct" | "question"
}
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context

If not clear from conversation:
1. What product are they promoting? (Check if S1 ran earlier — use `recommended_program` from context)
2. Which platform? (If "all", generate for LinkedIn + X + Reddit)
3. Any personal experience with the product? (Authentic stories convert 3-5x better)

If user just says "write a post for HeyGen" → default to LinkedIn, conversational tone, soft CTA.

If product details are missing, use `web_search "[product name] features pricing"` to research.

### Step 2: Research the Product

Even if product info is provided, do a quick `web_search` to find:
- Recent product updates or launches (recency = virality)
- Common pain points the product solves (hook material)
- Competitor comparisons (contrast = engagement)
- Real user testimonials or reviews (social proof)

Extract 2-3 **specific details** — exact numbers, real features, concrete use cases. Generic "this tool is amazing" posts don't go viral.

### Step 2.5: Research Winning Formats (data-driven)

Before picking a framework, check what's already working for this topic:

**If `trending-content-scout` or `content-angle-ranker` ran earlier:**
- Use `pattern_analysis.winning_formats` → pick the format with highest engagement
- Use `pattern_analysis.winning_hooks` → pick the hook style backed by data
- Use `engagement_benchmark` → know what "good" looks like for this keyword
- If `content-angle-ranker` provided a `recommended_angle` → use it as the angle

**If no scout data available (quick mode):**
- `web_search "[product name] review site:linkedin.com"` → check top LinkedIn posts
- `web_search "[product name] site:x.com"` → check top tweets
- Look for: post length, format (story vs list vs question), engagement signals visible in snippets
- Estimate which format works best on target platform

**Apply findings to framework selection:**
- Data > intuition. If comparisons get 2x engagement vs reviews in this niche, write a comparison
- If bold_claim hooks dominate top content → use a bold claim hook, even if you'd normally use a question
- If the `engagement_benchmark.top_10_percent_threshold` is known → set that as the target to beat

This step takes <2 minutes but significantly increases the odds of creating content that
performs above the benchmark rather than below it.

### Step 3: Pick the Viral Framework

Select from `references/viral-frameworks.md` based on product + platform + angle.

If user specified an `angle`, use that framework. Otherwise, auto-select:

| Platform | Best Default Framework |
|----------|----------------------|
| LinkedIn | Transformation Story or Contrarian Take |
| X | Thread (Problem → Solution) or Hot Take |
| Reddit | Genuine Recommendation or Problem-Solve |
| Facebook | Before/After or Listicle |

### Step 4: Write the Post

Apply the selected framework from `references/viral-frameworks.md`.

**Critical rules:**
1. **Hook in first line** — reader decides in 1.5 seconds whether to keep reading
2. **Specific > generic** — "saved 4 hours/week on video editing" beats "great tool"
3. **Story > pitch** — wrap the recommendation in a narrative or discovery
4. **Platform-native format** — see `references/platform-specs.md` for formatting rules
5. **One CTA only** — don't overwhelm. One clear next step
6. **FTC compliance** — include disclosure per `shared/references/ftc-compliance.md` placement rules

**Never do:**
- Start with "I'm excited to share..." (LinkedIn death sentence)
- Use "game-changer", "revolutionary", "hands down the best" (empty superlatives)
- Put the link in the main post body on LinkedIn (algorithm penalty)
- Hard-sell in the first sentence
- Mention commission rates or that you're an affiliate (FTC requires disclosure, not details)
- Include "Powered by Affitor" branding (see `shared/references/affitor-branding.md`)

### Step 5: Add FTC Disclosure

Per platform (from `shared/references/ftc-compliance.md`):
- **LinkedIn:** "#ad | Affiliate link" at the end of the post body
- **X:** "#ad" in the tweet containing the link (usually last tweet in thread)
- **Reddit:** "Full disclosure: affiliate link" at the bottom
- **Facebook:** "#ad | Affiliate link" at the end

### Step 6: Format Output

Present the post ready to copy-paste. Include:
1. The post content (formatted for the platform)
2. Where to place the affiliate link
3. Best time to post (platform-specific)
4. 2-3 engagement tips for the specific platform

### Step 7: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] FTC disclosure present and correctly placed per platform rules
- [ ] Hook is within platform character cutoff (LinkedIn: 210 chars)
- [ ] No banned phrases: "game-changer", "revolutionary", "I'm excited to share"
- [ ] Affiliate link NOT in LinkedIn post body (first comment instead)
- [ ] Single CTA only — not multiple competing calls to action
- [ ] No "Powered by Affitor" branding (social posts = no branding)

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

Other skills can consume these fields from conversation context:

```
{
  output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
  posts: [
    {
      platform: string         # "linkedin" | "x" | "reddit" | "facebook"
      framework: string        # Which viral framework was used
      content: string          # The full post text, ready to copy-paste
      link_placement: string   # Where to put the affiliate link
      disclosure: string       # FTC disclosure text included
      hashtags: string[]       # Suggested hashtags (if applicable)
      best_time: string        # Best posting time for this platform
    }
  ]
  product_name: string         # For downstream skill chaining
  content_angle: string        # The angle used (for consistency across content)
  hook_used: string            # The opening hook line (for repurposing across platforms)
}
```

## Output Format

```
## Viral Post: [Product Name] on [Platform]

**Framework:** [Name of viral framework used]
**Angle:** [The content angle]


### Posting Guide

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Link placement | [Where to put the link] |
| Best time to post | [Platform-specific optimal time] |
| Expected engagement | [What metrics to watch] |

### Engagement Tips

1. [Tip specific to this platform + content type]
2. [Tip about responding to comments]
3. [Tip about amplifying reach]

### Variations

Want more options? Try these angles:
- **[Framework 2]:** [1-line preview of alternative approach]
- **[Framework 3]:** [1-line preview of alternative approach]
```

When platform = "all", generate separate sections for LinkedIn, X, and Reddit.

## Error Handling

- **No product info:** Ask the user what product they want to promote. Suggest running `affiliate-program-search` first.
- **Unknown platform:** Default to LinkedIn. Mention available platforms.
- **No personal experience:** Generate research-based content. Flag that personal stories convert better and suggest the user adds their own experience.
- **Product has no public info:** Use `web_search` to find product details. If truly nothing found, ask user to describe the product.
- **Controversial product:** If the product has significant negative reviews or ethical concerns, flag this to the user and suggest adjusting the angle.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
User: "Write a LinkedIn post promoting HeyGen"
→ Research HeyGen (AI video, 30% recurring, 60-day cookie)
→ Select "Transformation Story" framework for LinkedIn
→ Write: hook about video creation pain → discovered HeyGen → specific result → soft CTA
→ Link in first comment, FTC disclosure in post body

**Example 2:**
User: "Create an X thread about Semrush for SEO marketers"
→ Research Semrush features + recent updates
→ Select "Thread: Problem → Solution" framework
→ Write: 5-7 tweet thread, hook → pain points → how Semrush solves each → results → CTA in last tweet
→ FTC "#ad" in the tweet with the link

**Example 3:**
User: "I've been using Notion for 2 years, help me write a Reddit post"
→ Use personal experience as the core (authenticity = Reddit gold)
→ Select "Genuine Recommendation" framework
→ Write: problem context → how they discovered Notion → specific workflows → natural mention
→ "Full disclosure: affiliate link" at bottom
→ Recommend posting in r/productivity or r/Notion

**Example 4:**
User: "Promote GetResponse on all platforms"
→ Research GetResponse (email marketing, 33% recurring)
→ Generate 3 posts: LinkedIn (Transformation Story), X (Thread), Reddit (Genuine Recommendation)
→ Each tailored to platform format, audience, and link rules

## Revenue & Action Plan

### Expected Outcomes
- **Revenue potential**: A well-crafted social post drives 50-500 affiliate link clicks. At 2-3% conversion and $50 avg commission = $50-750 per post. Viral posts (10x average engagement) can drive $1,000+ in a single day
- **Benchmark**: Consistent posters (5x/week) report $300-1,500/month in affiliate revenue from social media alone. The first $100 comes from your 20th-30th post, not your first
- **Key metric to track**: Affiliate link clicks per post. Use UTM parameters: `?utm_source=[platform]&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=[post_date]`

### Do This Right Now (15 min)
1. **Post it NOW** — the content is ready, don't overthink
2. If LinkedIn: put the affiliate link as the FIRST COMMENT immediately after posting
3. If X: pin the thread or tweet to your profile for maximum visibility
4. Engage with the first 5 comments within 30 minutes — early engagement signals boost reach 3-5x

### Track Your Results
After 24 hours: how many affiliate link clicks? After 7 days: any commissions attributed? The winning formula is: post → measure → repeat what works → ignore what doesn't.

> **Next step — copy-paste this prompt:**
> "Create a 30-day content calendar based on this winning post angle" → runs `social-media-scheduler`

## Flywheel Connections

### Feeds Into
- `affiliate-blog-builder` (S3) — viral post content expanded into long-form articles
- `content-pillar-atomizer` (S2) — successful posts become pillar content to atomize
- `social-media-scheduler` (S5) — posts ready to schedule
- `ab-test-generator` (S6) — post variants for A/B testing

### Fed By
- `trending-content-scout` (S1) — winning formats, hooks, engagement benchmarks
- `content-angle-ranker` (S1) — recommended angle with format, hook, and parameters
- `affiliate-program-search` (S1) — `recommended_program` product data
- `niche-opportunity-finder` (S1) — niche analysis and audience angles
- `purple-cow-audit` (S1) — `remarkability_score` and what makes the product shareable
- `competitor-spy` (S1) — content gaps to exploit

### Feedback Loop
- `performance-report` (S6) reveals which post types and angles get highest engagement → optimize framework selection on next run

## Quality Gate

Before delivering output, verify:

1. Would I share this on MY personal social?
2. Contains specific, surprising detail? (not generic)
3. Respects reader's intelligence?
4. Remarkable enough to share? (Purple Cow test)
5. Irresistible offer framing? (if S4 offer skills ran)

Any NO → rewrite before delivering.

## Volume Mode

When `mode: "volume"`:
- Generate 5-10 variations instead of 1
- Prioritize speed + variety over perfection
- Tag each with variant ID for A/B tracking
- Let data pick the winner (GaryVee philosophy)

```yaml
volume_output:
  variants:
    - id: string
      content: string
      angle: string
```

```yaml
chain_metadata:
  skill_slug: "viral-post-writer"
  stage: "content"
  timestamp: string
  suggested_next:
    - "social-media-scheduler"
    - "content-pillar-atomizer"
    - "affiliate-blog-builder"
```

## 33. Expert Skill: content-research-brief
> **Path within category:** `skills/content/content-research-brief/SKILL.md`


# Content Research Brief

Research a topic by collecting 5-10 real source articles, auto-tagging them by theme,
extracting key data points, and synthesizing unique content angles. The output is a
structured research brief that any downstream content skill can consume.

**The problem this solves:** Most AI-written affiliate content is generic because it's
written from the model's training data — not from real, current sources. This skill
forces research-first content creation: find real articles, extract real data, then
write from those sources. The result is content with specific stats, real quotes, and
current information that readers (and Google) actually value.

Inspired by the [content-pipeline](https://github.com/Affitor/content-pipeline) approach:
Topic → Search → Select sources → Synthesize → Write with context.

## Stage

This skill belongs to Stage S2: Content — but acts as the research foundation for all content skills.

## When to Use

- Before writing any article, blog post, or long-form content
- When you need current data and stats about a topic (not just AI-generated claims)
- When creating comparison content (need real feature/pricing data from sources)
- When writing about a product launch, funding round, or industry trend
- After `trending-content-scout` identifies a topic — research it deeper
- When you want unique angles: N sources → N different content pieces

## Input Schema

```yaml
topic: string                  # (required) "HeyGen AI video tool", "email marketing trends 2024"
source_count: number           # (optional, default: 7) How many sources to collect (3-10)
source_types: string[]         # (optional, default: ["news", "blog"])
                               # Options: "news" | "blog" | "linkedin" | "youtube" | "reddit" | "academic"
freshness: string              # (optional, default: "month") "day" | "week" | "month" | "year" | "any"
product: object                # (optional) Focus research on a specific product
  name: string                 # "HeyGen"
  url: string                  # "https://heygen.com"
language: string               # (optional, default: "en") "en" | "vi" | any ISO 639-1 code
angle_count: number            # (optional, default: 3) How many unique content angles to generate
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Search for Sources

Execute multiple searches to find diverse, high-quality sources:

```
Primary search:
  web_search "[topic]" → top results
  
Source-type-specific searches:
  IF "news" in source_types:
    web_search "[topic] news [current year]" → recent news articles
  IF "blog" in source_types:
    web_search "[topic] blog review analysis" → in-depth blog posts
  IF "linkedin" in source_types:
    web_search "[topic] site:linkedin.com" → LinkedIn posts/articles
  IF "youtube" in source_types:
    web_search "[topic] site:youtube.com" → YouTube videos with descriptions
  IF "reddit" in source_types:
    web_search "[topic] site:reddit.com" → Reddit discussions with real user opinions
  IF "academic" in source_types:
    web_search "[topic] research study data statistics" → data-heavy sources

Product-specific (if product provided):
  web_search "[product.name] review [current year]"
  web_search "[product.name] alternatives comparison"
  web_search "[product.name] pricing features"
  web_search "[product.name] news launch update"
```

Collect 15-20 search results, then filter down to `source_count` best sources.

### Step 2: Fetch and Extract Source Content

For each selected source:
1. `web_fetch [url]` → extract full article text
2. If fetch fails (paywall, timeout) → use search snippet as summary, note limitation
3. Extract from each source:
   - **Title** and **URL**
   - **Published date** (if available)
   - **Key data points**: stats, numbers, percentages, dollar amounts
   - **Key quotes**: noteworthy statements from experts or users
   - **Main argument/thesis**: what is this source's core message?
   - **Unique information**: what does this source have that others don't?

### Step 3: Auto-Tag Sources

Tag each source with 1-3 theme tags:

| Tag | Trigger Keywords |
|-----|-----------------|
| **AI** | artificial intelligence, machine learning, GPT, neural, model |
| **Funding** | raised, funding, series A/B/C, investment, valuation, IPO |
| **SaaS** | software, subscription, platform, B2B, enterprise |
| **Tools** | tool, app, feature, integration, API, plugin |
| **Trends** | trend, growing, emerging, future, prediction, forecast |
| **Startup** | startup, founder, launch, early-stage, bootstrapped |
| **Growth** | revenue, ARR, users, growth, scale, market share |
| **Industry** | market, industry, sector, regulation, compliance |
| **Pricing** | pricing, cost, free tier, discount, plan, subscription |
| **Comparison** | vs, versus, alternative, compare, switch, migrate |
| **Tutorial** | how to, guide, step-by-step, tutorial, walkthrough |
| **Opinion** | I think, in my experience, hot take, unpopular opinion |

### Step 4: Extract Key Data Points

From all sources combined, extract a master list of:

**Stats & Numbers:**
- Revenue/valuation figures
- User counts / growth rates
- Market size data
- Performance metrics
- Pricing data points

**Quotes & Insights:**
- Expert opinions
- User testimonials (from Reddit, reviews)
- Founder/CEO statements
- Analyst predictions

**Facts & Features:**
- Product features mentioned across multiple sources
- Recent updates/launches
- Integration ecosystem
- Competitive positioning

### Step 5: Synthesize Unique Angles

From the collected sources, generate `angle_count` unique content angles.

**Angle generation rules:**
1. Each angle must use a DIFFERENT primary source as its foundation
2. All angles use ALL sources as context (richer data)
3. Each angle must have a distinct hook and perspective
4. At least one angle should be contrarian or non-obvious

**For each angle:**
```yaml
Angle:
  title: string                # Specific, could be a headline
  primary_source: string       # Which source drives this angle
  hook: string                 # Opening line
  key_data: string[]           # 2-3 data points from sources that support this angle
  format_suggestion: string    # "linkedin_post" | "blog_article" | "tiktok_script" | "twitter_thread"
  unique_value: string         # What makes this angle different from generic AI-written content
```

### Step 6: Compile Research Brief

Organize everything into a structured brief that downstream skills can consume.

### Step 7: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] All sources are real URLs (not hallucinated)
- [ ] Data points are attributed to specific sources
- [ ] At least 3 sources were successfully fetched (not just search snippets)
- [ ] Angles are genuinely different from each other (not rephrased versions)
- [ ] Tags accurately reflect source content
- [ ] Brief includes both positive and critical/balanced perspectives

If any check fails, fix before delivering. Do not flag checklist to user.

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Pick an angle** and run the suggested content skill
2. **Combine angles** — use `content-pillar-atomizer` to turn one angle into 15+ pieces
3. **Add visuals** — use `infographic-generator` to create a data infographic from the key stats
```

## Error Handling

- **Topic too vague:** Ask user to narrow down. *"'Marketing' is too broad. Can you specify? e.g., 'email marketing automation tools' or 'TikTok marketing for SaaS'."*
- **Few sources found:** If <3 sources, note: *"Limited sources available for this topic. The brief may lack depth. Consider broadening the topic or checking if it's too niche."*
- **Most sources behind paywalls:** Use search snippets. Note: *"[X] sources couldn't be fully fetched (paywalls). Brief uses search snippets for those. Data may be less detailed."*
- **Sources are all from the same perspective:** Note bias. *"Warning: all [X] sources are positive reviews. No critical perspectives found. Consider adding 'reddit' or 'opinion' to source_types for balanced content."*
- **Outdated sources:** If freshness filter returns old results, widen the time range and note: *"Most recent sources are from [date]. This topic may not have recent coverage."*
- **Non-English topic:** Research in the specified language. Note if source diversity is limited in that language.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
User: "Research HeyGen for a LinkedIn post"
→ topic: "HeyGen AI video", source_types: ["news", "blog", "linkedin"], freshness: "month"
→ Collect 7 sources: 2 news (HeyGen raises $60M), 3 blog reviews, 2 LinkedIn posts
→ Tags: AI (7), Funding (2), Tools (5), Comparison (1)
→ Key stats: "$60M Series A", "40K+ businesses", "Avatar 3.0 launch"
→ Angles: (1) "HeyGen just raised $60M — here's what it means for AI video" (LinkedIn),
  (2) "I tested HeyGen vs Synthesia for 30 days" (blog), (3) "AI video tools are killing
  the $45B video production industry" (Twitter thread)

**Example 2:**
User: "Brief me on email marketing trends, I want to write a comparison blog post"
→ topic: "email marketing trends 2024", source_types: ["news", "blog", "reddit"]
→ Collect 8 sources covering: AI personalization, interactive emails, privacy changes, deliverability
→ Angles focused on comparison: "ConvertKit vs Mailchimp in 2024: the real differences after
  Apple Mail Privacy Protection"

**Example 3:**
User: "Research what people are really saying about ClickUp on Reddit"
→ topic: "ClickUp", source_types: ["reddit", "blog"], freshness: "month"
→ 4 Reddit threads (raw opinions), 3 blog reviews
→ Unique angle: Reddit users love the free tier but hate the learning curve →
  "ClickUp: the free tool that takes a month to learn (and why it's still worth it)"

## Feedback & Issue Reporting

When this skill produces unexpected, incomplete, or incorrect output, generate a
`skill_feedback` block (see `shared/references/feedback-protocol.md` for full schema).

**Skill-specific failure modes:**
- **Most sources paywalled:** <3 sources fully fetched. Report as `data_quality`, list which URLs failed.
- **All sources same perspective:** No balanced/critical viewpoints found. Report as `data_quality`, note bias direction.
- **Hallucinated stats:** Agent generated a stat not from any fetched source. Report as `hallucination`, critical severity.
- **Angles not unique:** All 3 angles are rephrased versions of the same take. Report as `wrong_output`.

**Auto-detect triggers:**
- `sources_fetched` < 3 (most failed)
- All source `tags` are identical (no diversity)
- Any data point in `master_data.stats` cannot be traced to a specific source URL
- `angles` array has <2 entries

## 34. Expert Skill: twitter-thread-writer
> **Path within category:** `skills/content/twitter-thread-writer/SKILL.md`


# Twitter Thread Writer

Write X/Twitter threads that deliver genuine value, build authority, and naturally
recommend affiliate products without feeling like ads. The best affiliate threads
get bookmarked for the insights and clicked for the product recommendation.

## Stage

This skill belongs to Stage S2: Content

## When to Use

- User wants to promote an affiliate product on X/Twitter
- User wants to build an audience on X while monetizing with affiliate links
- User has expertise to share and wants to weave in a product recommendation
- User asks how to write threads that convert without being spammy
- User wants content that compounds (bookmarks → future impressions)

## Input Schema

```
{
  product: {
    name: string              # (required) "ConvertKit"
    description: string       # (optional) What it does
    url: string               # (optional) Affiliate link
    reward_value: string      # (optional) For context only — never shown in thread
  }
  thread_angle: string        # (optional, default: auto) See Thread Frameworks below
  expertise_area: string      # (optional) Creator's area of authority — "email marketing", "SaaS growth"
  audience: string            # (optional) "founders", "freelancers", "content creators"
  tone: string                # (optional, default: "direct") "direct" | "educational" | "storytelling" | "contrarian"
  tweet_count: number         # (optional, default: 8) Number of tweets in thread: 5-15
  personal_story: string      # (optional) Real experience or result to anchor the thread
  cta_style: string           # (optional, default: "soft") "soft" | "direct" | "question"
}
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Research the Product and Angle

Use `web_search "[product name] best features use cases"` and
`web_search "[product name] vs [competitor]"` to find:
- The 2-3 strongest use cases (thread body material)
- The problem it solves that X audiences care about
- Any recent updates, launches, or news (recency boosts engagement)
- Real user testimonials or case study numbers (third-party proof)

Also search `web_search "site:twitter.com [product name] affiliate"` to see what
existing threads look like — then do something different or better.

### Step 2: Select the Thread Framework

| Framework | Structure | Best For |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Lessons Learned** | "I used [product] for X months. Here's what I learned:" → 7 insights → CTA | Tools you've genuinely used |
| **Problem → Solution** | Hook pain → Agitate it → Introduce solution → Show how it solves each pain → CTA | High-awareness problems |
| **Contrarian Take** | "Everyone says [common advice]. I disagree. [product] changed my mind." | Standing out in crowded niches |
| **Numbers Story** | "From [before metric] to [after metric] using [product]. Here's how:" → step-by-step → CTA | When you have real results |
| **How-to Tutorial** | "How to [achieve outcome] with [product] in [timeframe]:" → step-by-step → CTA | Educational, drives bookmarks |
| **Tool Stack** | "My [role] tool stack in 2024: Thread on each → [product] gets its own deep-dive tweet → CTA | Multi-product threads |
| **Myth Busting** | "5 myths about [problem space] — and what actually works:" → each myth → [product] as the solution | High engagement, saves |

Auto-select based on:
- Has personal experience → Numbers Story or Lessons Learned
- No personal experience → How-to Tutorial or Problem → Solution
- Large audience, strong takes → Contrarian Take
- Beginner-friendly product → How-to Tutorial

### Step 3: Write the Hook Tweet (Tweet 1)

The hook tweet determines if anyone reads tweet 2. It must:
- Promise a specific, tangible outcome ("how I 3x'd my email open rate")
- Or state a bold, curiosity-generating claim ("most email marketing advice is wrong")
- Or open a story loop ("6 months ago I had 400 email subscribers. Today I have 12,000.")
- End with a signal that a thread follows: "A thread:" or "Here's how:" or "Thread 🧵"

Never start with: "I want to share...", "In this thread...", "Have you ever..."
Never use buzzwords as hooks: "game-changing", "revolutionary", "must-read"

**Hook formula:** [Specific outcome or bold claim] + [Credibility signal] + [Thread signal]

### Step 4: Write the Body Tweets (Tweets 2-N)

Each tweet in the body must:
1. **Deliver a complete thought** — readable as a standalone tweet
2. **Build on the previous tweet** — threads should reward people who read all the way
3. **Include a specific detail** — numbers, names, steps, not vague generalizations
4. **Stay under 280 characters** — hard limit. No tweet should require expanding
5. **Use whitespace** — line breaks between ideas, not wall-of-text tweets

Place the product recommendation at 60-70% through the thread (tweet 5-7 of 8-10).
It should feel discovered, not pitched:
- "The tool that actually made this easy for me: [product name]"
- "I tried 4 tools before finding [product]. Here's why it worked:"
- "If I had to pick one tool for this: [product]"

Mention the product once prominently. A brief second mention in the CTA tweet is fine.

### Step 5: Write the CTA Tweet (Last Tweet)

The CTA tweet should:
1. Summarize what the thread delivered
2. Recommend action (try the product, sign up, or check it out)
3. Include the affiliate link OR direct to bio for the link
4. Include FTC disclosure "#ad" per `shared/references/ftc-compliance.md`

Soft CTA example: "If you want to try [product], there's a free trial at [link]. I use it daily. #ad"
Direct CTA: "[Product] is how I [result]. Link to try it free: [link] #ad"

### Step 6: Add Engagement Mechanics

Increase bookmark and retweet probability:
1. **Add a summary tweet** after the CTA: "TL;DR: [3 bullets from the thread]"
   Summaries drive bookmarks from skimmers.
2. **First reply** (pinned under thread): "If you found this useful, follow me for more [topic]."
3. **Engagement question** somewhere in thread: "Which of these do you do already?
   Drop your answer below." (Boosts reply count → algorithm boost)

### Step 7: Format Output

Present tweets numbered and ready to paste. Include character count for each.
Flag any tweet at 250+ characters for potential trimming.

### Step 8: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] Every tweet is under 280 characters
- [ ] Product mention appears at 60-70% through the thread
- [ ] FTC "#ad" is in the CTA tweet containing the link
- [ ] Hook tweet promises specific outcome or states bold claim
- [ ] No banned hook starts: "In this thread...", "I want to share..."

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```
{
  output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
  thread: [
    {
      tweet_number: number      # 1, 2, 3...
      content: string           # Full tweet text
      char_count: number        # Character count
      role: string              # "hook" | "body" | "product_mention" | "cta" | "summary"
    }
  ]
  framework: string             # Which framework was used
  product_mention_tweet: number # Which tweet number introduces the product
  disclosure_tweet: number      # Which tweet has #ad
  suggested_hashtags: string[]  # 2-3 hashtags for the thread
  best_time_to_post: string     # Optimal posting time for X
  product_name: string
  content_angle: string
}
```

## Output Format

```
## Twitter Thread: [Product Name]

**Framework:** [Name]
**Angle:** [Content angle]
**Tweets:** [N] tweets


**Tweet 2** — [X chars]
[Tweet content]


**Tweet [N] (CTA)** — [X chars]
[Tweet content including #ad disclosure]


### Posting Guide

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Best time to post | [Day + time] |
| First action after posting | [Like all tweets to boost visibility, pin reply] |
| Expected engagement pattern | [What metrics to watch] |

### Alternate Hook Options

- **[Hook style 2]:** "[Alternative tweet 1]"
- **[Hook style 3]:** "[Alternative tweet 1]"
```

## Error Handling

- **No product info:** Pull `recommended_program` from S1 context if available.
  Otherwise ask what product they want to promote.
- **No personal experience:** Write research-based content. Flag that personal
  experience threads get 2-3x more engagement and suggest adding a real data point.
- **Thread feels too promotional too early:** Move product mention to tweet 6+.
  Add 1-2 more value tweets before the recommendation.
- **Content is too generic:** Use `web_search` to add specific stats, quotes, or
  examples. Replace every vague claim with a concrete number or example.
- **Tweet over 280 characters:** Auto-split or suggest cut. Never truncate — the
  full thought must fit in one tweet.
- **Creator has no X following:** Add note: "New accounts should engage in replies
  for 1-2 weeks before posting threads. Algorithm rewards accounts with engagement history."

## Examples

**Example 1:**
User: "Write a Twitter thread promoting ConvertKit to freelancers"
→ Angle: "How I built a 3,000-subscriber email list as a freelancer — what worked"
→ Framework: Numbers Story
→ 9 tweets: Hook (metrics) → 6 lessons → ConvertKit mention at tweet 6 → CTA + #ad
→ Emphasis: free plan, creator-friendly, no bloat

**Example 2:**
User: "I want to write a contrarian thread about email marketing tools"
→ Angle: "Most people pick the wrong email platform. Here's why:"
→ Framework: Contrarian Take
→ Myths to bust: "Mailchimp is fine for beginners", "you need fancy automations"
→ Natural product mention: "After trying 5 tools, I settled on ConvertKit because..."

**Example 3:**
User: "8-tweet thread about HeyGen for video creators"
→ Framework: How-to Tutorial — "How to create a talking-head video without a camera"
→ Step-by-step: sign up → upload script → pick avatar → generate → edit → export
→ Product mention woven in at step 1 (that's HeyGen)
→ CTA: "HeyGen has a free plan — I made my first 3 videos for free: [link] #ad"

- `shared/references/flywheel-connections.md` — master flywheel connection map

## Revenue & Action Plan

### Expected Outcomes
- **Revenue potential**: A viral thread (1,000+ bookmarks) can drive 200-500 affiliate link clicks from the CTA tweet. At 3% conversion and $50 commission = $300-750 per thread. Threads compound — bookmarked threads resurface in search for months
- **Benchmark**: Affiliate threads with 5,000+ impressions and 2%+ engagement rate typically convert at $0.10-0.50 per impression in affiliate revenue
- **Key metric to track**: CTA tweet click-through rate. Industry benchmark: 1-3% CTR on the last tweet. Below 1% = weak CTA or product-thread mismatch

### Do This Right Now (15 min)
1. **Post the thread NOW** at the recommended time (or schedule for the next optimal window)
2. Immediately like all your tweets in the thread (boosts visibility)
3. Post the pinned reply within 2 minutes of the thread going live
4. Reply to every comment in the first hour — this is when the algorithm decides if your thread spreads

### Track Your Results
After 48 hours: how many clicks on the affiliate link? How many bookmarks? Bookmarks predict long-term traffic — bookmarked threads get resurfaced by the algorithm for weeks.

> "Expand my Twitter thread about [product] into a full blog review" → runs `affiliate-blog-builder`

# Content Pillar Atomizer

Take 1 blog post or article and generate 15-30 platform-native micro-content pieces. This is NOT reformatting — it's re-contextualizing each piece for the platform's culture, format, and audience expectations. A LinkedIn post reads nothing like a Reddit comment, even if they carry the same insight.

## Stage

S2: Content Creation — This IS content creation, just at 10x scale. One piece of deep work becomes a month of social content.

## When to Use

- User has a blog post, article, or long-form content and wants to maximize its reach
- User asks to "repurpose" or "atomize" content
- User says "turn this into social posts", "content multiplication", "pillar content"
- After `affiliate-blog-builder` (S3) produces an article — atomize it into social
- User wants to maintain consistent content output without creating from scratch daily

## Input Schema

```yaml
pillar_content: string        # REQUIRED — the full blog post/article text, or URL to fetch

platforms: string[]           # OPTIONAL — target platforms
                              # Options: "twitter", "linkedin", "reddit", "tiktok", "email", "threads"
                              # Default: ["twitter", "linkedin", "reddit"]

product: object               # OPTIONAL — affiliate product being promoted
  name: string
  url: string
  reward_value: string

mode: string                  # OPTIONAL — "quality" | "volume"
                              # Default: "quality"

tone: string                  # OPTIONAL — "professional" | "casual" | "edgy" | "educational"
                              # Default: inferred from pillar content
```

**Chaining from S3**: If `affiliate-blog-builder` was run, use its output article as `pillar_content`.

**Chaining from S1 monopoly-niche-finder**: Use `monopoly_niche` positioning to angle all micro-content.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Pillar Content

1. If URL provided, use `web_fetch` to retrieve content
2. Extract: key insights (5-8), data points, quotes, frameworks, stories, opinions
3. Identify the "atomic units" — self-contained ideas that work independently
4. Note the product/affiliate angle (if present)

### Step 1.5: Check Platform Performance for This Topic (data-driven)

Before atomizing equally across all platforms, understand which platforms are hot for this topic:

**If `trending-content-scout` ran:**
- Use platform-level engagement data from `pattern_analysis`
- Check `engagement_benchmark.platform_averages` — which platform has highest engagement for this keyword?
- Prioritize platforms where this topic has highest engagement
- Adjust platform allocation accordingly (see below)

**Quick check (no scout data):**
- `web_search "[topic] youtube vs tiktok vs linkedin"` → which platform dominates discussion?
- Check: is this topic more visual (→ TikTok/YouTube heavy) or professional (→ LinkedIn heavy)?
- Look for: which platform shows up most in search results for this topic?

**Apply to atomization allocation:**
- Default: equal split across platforms
- Data-driven: proportional to engagement potential
  - If TikTok engagement is 5x LinkedIn for this topic → generate 5 TikTok scripts, 1 LinkedIn post
  - If Reddit has high engagement → don't skip Reddit (often ignored by affiliates = opportunity)
  - If YouTube dominates → consider atomizing into YouTube Shorts scripts instead of just TikTok

**Platform allocation example:**
```
Default (no data):    Twitter: 5 | LinkedIn: 3 | Reddit: 3 | TikTok: 3 | Email: 2
Data-driven (TikTok hot): Twitter: 3 | LinkedIn: 1 | Reddit: 2 | TikTok: 6 | Email: 2
Data-driven (LinkedIn hot): Twitter: 3 | LinkedIn: 5 | Reddit: 2 | TikTok: 2 | Email: 2
```

### Step 2: Platform Mapping

Read `shared/references/platform-rules.md` for platform-specific rules.

For each platform, map the culture:

| Platform | Format | Tone | Length | CTA Style |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Twitter/X | Thread or single tweet | Punchy, opinionated | 280 chars or 5-10 tweet thread | Last tweet |
| LinkedIn | Story or insight post | Professional, first-person | 1300 chars | Soft CTA in comments |
| Reddit | Value-first post/comment | Helpful, honest, skeptical-aware | Variable | Disclosure + subtle |
| TikTok | Script with hook | Casual, energetic | 30-60s script | Verbal + bio link |
| Email | Newsletter section | Conversational | 200-400 words | Direct link |
| Threads | Conversational take | Casual, authentic | 500 chars | Bio link |

### Step 3: Generate Micro-Content

For each platform, generate pieces from different atomic units:

- **Twitter**: 3-5 pieces (1 thread, 2-3 standalone tweets, 1 hot take)
- **LinkedIn**: 2-3 pieces (1 story post, 1 insight post, 1 question post)
- **Reddit**: 2-3 pieces (1 detailed post, 1-2 comment-ready responses)
- **TikTok**: 2-3 scripts (1 educational, 1 hot take, 1 tutorial)
- **Email**: 1-2 pieces (newsletter section, dedicated email)
- **Threads**: 2-3 pieces (conversational takes)

Each piece must:
- Stand alone (makes sense without reading the pillar)
- Feel native to the platform (not a copy-paste resize)
- Carry one clear insight or value point
- Include appropriate FTC disclosure for affiliate content

### Step 4: Tag for Tracking

Tag each piece with:
- Source pillar reference
- Platform
- Content type (thread, single, story, script)
- Affiliate product (if applicable)
- Suggested posting time/day

### Step 5: Self-Validation

- [ ] Each piece feels native to its platform (not copy-pasted)
- [ ] Each piece stands alone without needing the pillar
- [ ] FTC disclosure included where affiliate links present
- [ ] No two pieces on the same platform say the same thing
- [ ] Platform rules followed (Reddit skepticism, LinkedIn professionalism, etc.)

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"
atomized_content:
  pillar_title: string
  total_pieces: number
  platforms_covered: string[]

  pieces:
    - platform: string
      type: string              # "thread" | "single" | "story" | "script" | "email" | "comment"
      content: string           # The actual content, ready to post
      insight_source: string    # Which atomic unit from the pillar
      has_affiliate_link: boolean
      suggested_timing: string  # e.g., "Tuesday 9am"
      variant_id: string        # For volume mode A/B tracking

  content_pillars: string[]    # Atomic units extracted (for chaining)

chain_metadata:
  skill_slug: "content-pillar-atomizer"
  stage: "content"
  timestamp: string
  suggested_next:
    - "social-media-scheduler"
    - "email-drip-sequence"
    - "ab-test-generator"
```

## Output Format

```
## Content Atomizer: [Pillar Title]

### Pillar Analysis
- **Atomic units extracted:** X insights
- **Platforms:** [list]
- **Total pieces generated:** XX


### LinkedIn (X pieces)

**Story Post:**
[full LinkedIn post]


[Continue for each platform]

### Posting Schedule
| Day | Platform | Piece | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mon | Twitter | Thread | 9am |
| Tue | LinkedIn | Story | 8am |
| Wed | Reddit | Post | 12pm |
```

## Error Handling

- **No pillar content provided**: "Paste your blog post or article, or give me the URL and I'll fetch it."
- **Content too short**: "This is quite short for atomization. I'll extract what I can, but consider writing a longer pillar first with `affiliate-blog-builder`."
- **No affiliate angle**: Generate content without affiliate links. Pure value content builds audience for future promotions.
- **Platform not supported**: "I don't have specific rules for [platform]. I'll format it generically — review before posting."

## Examples

**Example 1:** "Atomize my HeyGen review blog post into social content"
→ Extract 6 key insights, generate 15 pieces across Twitter (thread + 3 tweets), LinkedIn (2 posts), Reddit (2 posts), TikTok (2 scripts).

**Example 2:** "Turn this article into LinkedIn and Twitter content"
→ Focus on 2 platforms only. Generate 3 LinkedIn posts (story, insight, question) and 5 Twitter pieces (thread, 3 tweets, hot take).

**Example 3:** "Atomize in volume mode" (after affiliate-blog-builder)
→ Pick up article from chain. Generate 25-30 pieces with multiple variations per platform for A/B testing.

## Revenue & Action Plan

### Expected Outcomes
- **Revenue potential**: Each atomized piece is a new touchpoint driving affiliate clicks. 15-30 pieces from 1 article = 15-30x more chances for commission
- **Benchmark**: Top affiliate content creators report 2-5% of social impressions convert to link clicks. At $50 avg commission, 10,000 impressions across all pieces = $100-250/month from ONE pillar article
- **Key metric to track**: Bio link / affiliate link CTR per platform — which platform drives the most clicks per impression?

### Do This Right Now (15 min)
1. Pick the **single strongest piece** from the output — the one with the most specific, surprising insight
2. Post it on your highest-engagement platform immediately
3. Add your affiliate link in bio or first comment
4. Set a reminder to post the next piece tomorrow

### Track Your Results
After 7 days, check: which platform generated the most affiliate link clicks? Double down on that platform, reduce effort on underperformers.

> **Next step — copy-paste this prompt:**
> "Schedule all my atomized content for the next 30 days" → runs `social-media-scheduler`

**LinkedIn posts with images get 2-3x more engagement.** This skill turns your content
into visual assets without design skills.

Inspired by [content-pipeline](https://github.com/Affitor/content-pipeline)'s Satori
rendering: AI writes the content → structured spec → rendered as a branded image.

## Stage

This skill belongs to Stage S2: Content

## When to Use

- After `viral-post-writer` creates a LinkedIn post — add a visual
- After `content-research-brief` collects stats — visualize them
- When creating comparison content — feature/pricing comparison chart
- When sharing data or stats — stat highlight cards
- When creating a listicle — visual checklist or numbered list
- For any social media post that would benefit from a branded image

## Input Schema

                               # "quote_card" — featured quote with attribution
                               # "feature_grid" — grid of features/benefits with icons
platform: string               # (optional, default: "linkedin")
                               # "linkedin" — 1080×1350 (portrait, optimal engagement)
                               # "instagram" — 1080×1080 (square)
                               # "twitter" — 1200×675 (landscape)
                               # "facebook" — 1200×630

output_format: string          # (optional, default: "spec")
                               # "spec" — structured JSON spec (for any renderer)
                               # "html" — renderable HTML/CSS (self-contained)
                               # "both" — spec + HTML
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Content and Select Type

Read the input content and detect the best infographic type:

| Content Pattern | Auto-detected Type |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Contains 1-3 prominent numbers/stats | `stat_highlight` |
| Contains "vs", comparison data | `comparison` |
| Contains numbered steps or a process | `process_flow` |
| Contains a list of items (3-10) | `checklist` or `feature_grid` |
| Contains dates or chronological events | `timeline` |
| Contains a notable quote | `quote_card` |
| Contains percentages or proportions | `data_chart` |

If `infographic_type` is provided, use that. Otherwise auto-detect.

### Step 2: Extract Visual Data

From the content, extract exactly what needs to appear in the infographic:

**For `stat_highlight`:**
```yaml
stats:
  - number: "30%"        # The big number
    label: "commission"   # What it measures
    context: "recurring"  # Additional context
  - number: "60"
    label: "cookie days"
    context: "industry avg: 30"
```

**For `comparison`:**
```yaml
items:
  - name: "HeyGen"
    features:
      - label: "Commission"
        value: "30% recurring"
        highlight: true         # winner for this row
      - label: "Cookie"
        value: "60 days"
        highlight: true
  - name: "Synthesia"
    features:
      - label: "Commission"
        value: "25% one-time"
        highlight: false
      - label: "Cookie"
        value: "30 days"
        highlight: false
```

**For `process_flow`:**
```yaml
steps:
  - number: 1
    title: "Research"
    description: "Find winning programs"
    icon: "🔍"
  - number: 2
    title: "Create"
    description: "Write content that converts"
    icon: "✍️"
```

**For `checklist`:**
```yaml
items:
  - text: "Recurring commission"
    checked: true
  - text: "60+ day cookie"
    checked: true
  - text: "Free trial available"
    checked: true
  - text: "Dedicated affiliate manager"
    checked: false
```

### Step 3: Design Layout

Based on type + platform, define the layout:

**Platform dimensions:**
| Platform | Width | Height | Aspect |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| LinkedIn | 1080 | 1350 | 4:5 (portrait) |
| Instagram | 1080 | 1080 | 1:1 (square) |
| Twitter | 1200 | 675 | 16:9 (landscape) |
| Facebook | 1200 | 630 | ~2:1 |
| Blog | 1200 | 800 | 3:2 |

**Layout structure (all types):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│         HEADER              │  10-15% height
│    Headline / Title         │

```

### Step 4: Generate Color Scheme

**If brand colors provided:** Use them directly.

**If no brand colors:** Generate a professional palette:

```yaml
# Default professional palette options
palettes:
  dark_modern:       # Dark background, light text
    bg: "#1A1A2E"
    text: "#FFFFFF"
    accent: "#0066FF"
    secondary: "#16213E"
    
  light_clean:       # Light background, dark text
    bg: "#FFFFFF"
    text: "#1A1A2E"
    accent: "#0066FF"
    secondary: "#F0F4F8"
    
  warm_bold:         # Warm tones
    bg: "#FFF8F0"
    text: "#2D2D2D"
    accent: "#FF6B35"
    secondary: "#FFE8D6"
    
  dark_gradient:     # Gradient dark
    bg: "linear-gradient(135deg, #1A1A2E, #16213E)"
    text: "#FFFFFF"
    accent: "#00D4AA"
    secondary: "#2A2A4A"
```

Auto-select based on platform:
- LinkedIn → `dark_modern` or `light_clean` (professional)
- Twitter → `dark_gradient` or `warm_bold` (attention-grabbing)
- Instagram → Any (most visual flexibility)

### Step 5: Generate All Copy

Write every piece of text that appears in the infographic:

```yaml
copy:
  headline: string          # Main title — bold, short (max 8 words)
  subheadline: string       # Optional supporting line
  body_items: string[]      # Data labels, descriptions, etc.
  cta: string               # Call-to-action text — "Link in bio" | "See comments for link"
  footer: string            # Brand name or @handle
  source: string            # "Data: list.affitor.com" or source attribution
```

**Copy rules:**
- Headlines: 3-8 words, bold claim or specific number
- All text must be readable at mobile scale (not too small)
- No more than 50 total words on the infographic (less = better)
- Data > adjectives (show numbers, not "amazing" or "incredible")

### Step 6: Output

**Spec output (default):**

Complete structured spec that any renderer can consume:

```yaml
infographic_spec:
  type: string
  platform: string
  dimensions:
    width: number
    height: number
  colors:
    background: string
    text: string
    accent: string
    secondary: string
  layout:
    header: object
    body: object
    footer: object
  data: object              # Type-specific data (stats, comparison items, steps, etc.)
  copy:
    headline: string
    subheadline: string
    body_items: string[]
    cta: string
    footer: string
    source: string
```

**HTML output (if `output_format` is "html" or "both"):**

Generate a self-contained HTML file with inline CSS that renders the infographic
at exact dimensions. This can be:
- Opened in a browser and screenshotted
- Rendered server-side with Satori or Puppeteer
- Used as a starting point for design iteration

```html
<!-- Self-contained, no external dependencies -->
<div style="width: 1080px; height: 1350px; ...">
  <!-- Header -->
  <!-- Body (type-specific) -->
  <!-- Footer -->
</div>
```

### Step 7: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] Total word count on infographic ≤ 50 words
- [ ] All text readable at 50% zoom (minimum effective font size)
- [ ] Color contrast meets accessibility (WCAG AA: 4.5:1 ratio)
- [ ] Data points are accurate and attributed
- [ ] Layout doesn't feel cramped — whitespace is intentional
- [ ] Platform dimensions are correct

If any check fails, fix before delivering.

## Output Format

```markdown
## Infographic: [Headline]

### Spec
- **Type:** [stat_highlight]
- **Platform:** [LinkedIn] — 1080×1350
- **Colors:** [dark_modern] — bg: #1A1A2E, accent: #0066FF

### Preview (text representation)

### Data

[Structured spec as YAML or JSON]

### HTML (if requested)

[Self-contained HTML/CSS code block]

### Next Steps
- Post to [platform] with your viral post from `viral-post-writer`
- Create variations for other platforms: `--platform instagram`
- Generate more infographics from different data in your `content-research-brief`
```

## Error Handling

- **Content has no extractable data:** Generate a `quote_card` or `checklist` type instead. Note: *"No numerical data found. Created a [type] infographic instead."*
- **Too much data for one infographic:** Select top 3-5 most impactful data points. Note: *"Content has [X] data points. Selected the [Y] most impactful for visual clarity. Consider creating multiple infographics."*
- **No brand colors:** Use default palette. Note: *"No brand colors specified. Using [palette name]. Add brand colors for consistent branding."*
- **HTML output too complex:** Simplify layout. Infographics should be simple — complexity kills visual impact.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
User: "Make an infographic comparing HeyGen vs Synthesia for LinkedIn"
→ type: comparison, platform: linkedin (1080×1350)
→ Extract: commission, cookie, rating, price for each
→ Output: side-by-side comparison card with winner highlighted
→ Dark modern palette, bold numbers

**Example 2:**
User: "Create a stat card from my research brief showing HeyGen's key numbers"
→ type: stat_highlight, platform: linkedin
→ Extract: "$60M raised", "40K businesses", "30% commission"
→ Output: 3 large numbers with labels and context

**Example 3:**
User: "Visualize the affiliate funnel steps as an infographic"
→ type: process_flow, platform: blog (1200×800)
→ Steps: Research → Content → Landing → Deploy → Track → Optimize
→ Output: horizontal flow with icons and brief descriptions

## 37. Expert Skill: tiktok-script-writer
> **Path within category:** `skills/content/tiktok-script-writer/SKILL.md`


# TikTok Script Writer

Write punchy 30-60 second video scripts for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube
Shorts that stop the scroll, demo the product naturally, and drive affiliate link
clicks. Every script is structured for vertical video: hook → problem → demo →
result → CTA.

## Stage

This skill belongs to Stage S2: Content

## When to Use

- User wants to promote an affiliate product on short-form video platforms
- User has an affiliate program picked (from S1) and needs TikTok/Reels content
- User asks for video script ideas for TikTok affiliate marketing
- User wants a hook-first script that converts viewers to buyers
- User creates content on TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts

## Input Schema

```
{
  product: {
    name: string              # (required) "HeyGen"
    description: string       # (optional) What it does — will be researched if missing
    url: string               # (optional) Affiliate link or product URL
    reward_value: string      # (optional) Commission info — never shown in script
  }
  duration: number            # (optional, default: 45) Target duration in seconds: 15 | 30 | 45 | 60
  platform: string            # (optional, default: "tiktok") "tiktok" | "reels" | "shorts" | "all"
  hook_style: string          # (optional, default: auto) "question" | "shock" | "relatable" | "bold_claim" | "demo_first"
  creator_persona: string     # (optional) "beginner marketer" | "tech reviewer" | "productivity nerd"
  has_product_access: boolean # (optional, default: true) Can creator do live demo?
  personal_experience: string # (optional) Real experience to weave in
  audience: string            # (optional) "freelancers" | "small business owners" | "students"
}
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Research the Product

If product details are sparse, use `web_search "[product name] what it does tutorial"` to find:
- The single most impressive thing the product does (demo-able in <20 seconds)
- The main pain it eliminates (hook material)
- A specific result users achieve (e.g., "make a talking avatar video in 2 minutes")
- Any free trial or free tier (reduces friction for CTA)

Concrete specifics > vague claims. "Creates a 2-minute video in 30 seconds" beats
"saves time on video creation".

### Step 1.5: Analyze Top Performing TikToks (data-driven)

Before selecting hook style, see what's actually winning in this niche on TikTok:

**If `trending-content-scout` ran earlier:**
- Use TikTok-specific data from `top_content`
- Extract: winning hooks, optimal duration, top creators' styles
- Use `engagement_benchmark` to set a target engagement score
- If `content-angle-ranker` provided a `recommended_angle` → use it

**If no scout data (quick mode):**
- `web_search "[product name] tiktok"` → find top TikTok videos
- `web_search "best [niche] tiktok viral"` → find format patterns
- `web_search "[product name] tiktok review"` → see existing content
- Note view counts, styles, and durations visible in search results

**Apply findings to script:**
- If demo_first hooks have 2x engagement in this niche → default to demo_first
- If 30-45s videos outperform 60s → adjust duration target
- If a specific creator style dominates → note as reference (adapt, don't copy)
- If `engagement_benchmark.median_views` is known → aim to beat it with better hook + format

This step takes <2 minutes but can 3x the script's potential by building on
proven patterns instead of guessing.

### Step 2: Select the Hook Style

Short-form video is won or lost in seconds 1-3. Pick the hook based on the product's
strongest angle:

| Hook Style | Template | Best For |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **Question** | "What if you could [result] without [pain]?" | Products that remove a hard task |
| **Shock/Stat** | "I replaced [expensive thing] with a $[price]/mo tool" | Cost/efficiency wins |
| **Relatable** | "[Frustrating situation]? Same. Then I found this." | Niche audience pain |
| **Bold Claim** | "This [tool] is the reason I [impressive result]" | Strong ROI proof |
| **Demo First** | [Open with screen recording of the coolest feature immediately] | Visual/AI tools |
| **Story Opener** | "6 months ago I was [before state]. Now [after state]. Here's why." | Transformation |

For AI tools and visual products → **Demo First** almost always wins on TikTok.
For SaaS productivity tools → **Relatable** or **Shock/Stat** hooks work well.

### Step 3: Structure the Script

Every script follows this structure (adapt timing to duration):

**For 45-second scripts:**
- 0-3s: Hook (spoken + on-screen text)
- 3-8s: Relatable pain or setup
- 8-30s: Live demo OR narrated walkthrough of key feature
- 30-38s: Specific result / proof
- 38-44s: CTA (bio link, comment for link, or "link in bio")
- 44-45s: FTC disclosure overlay

**For 30-second scripts:**
- 0-3s: Hook
- 3-15s: Demo the #1 feature
- 15-25s: Result + social proof
- 25-30s: CTA + disclosure

**For 60-second scripts:**
- 0-3s: Hook
- 3-10s: Problem setup
- 10-40s: Full demo (2-3 features)
- 40-52s: Results + pricing mention (anchoring)
- 52-58s: CTA
- 58-60s: FTC disclosure

### Step 4: Write the Script

Format scripts with:
- **[VISUAL]** — what's on screen (screen recording, hands typing, reaction face, b-roll)
- **[SPOKEN]** — what the creator says (keep sentences short, max 10 words each)
- **[TEXT OVERLAY]** — on-screen text (keywords for silent viewers — 40% watch with no sound)
- **[CAPTION]** — suggested TikTok caption + hashtags

Writing rules:
1. Sentences under 10 words. TikTok viewers process fast.
2. No filler phrases: "basically", "literally", "you know what I mean"
3. Every 3-5 seconds: new visual cut, new text overlay, or spoken transition
4. Sound-optional: the text overlay should tell the whole story without audio
5. End the hook WITH the setup — don't just ask a question, tease the answer
6. The demo must be REAL — no vague "and then it does this amazing thing"

### Step 5: Add FTC Disclosure

Per `shared/references/ftc-compliance.md` for short-form video:
- Verbal disclosure if spoken at all (not required but best practice)
- Text overlay "#ad" or "Affiliate link in bio" must appear during CTA section
- Disclosure must be visible for at least 3 seconds
- Do NOT bury in caption — overlay is required per FTC guidance

### Step 6: Add Production Notes

Include brief notes for the creator:
- What to screen-record vs. film on camera
- Suggested background music BPM range (fast = tech demos, mid = tutorials)
- Caption and hashtag strategy for the platform
- Best time to post on each platform

### Step 7: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] Spoken sentences under 10 words each
- [ ] New visual cut or text overlay every 3-5 seconds
- [ ] FTC "#ad" appears as text overlay, NOT buried in caption
- [ ] Disclosure overlay visible for at least 3 seconds
- [ ] Hook ends with setup, not just a question
- [ ] Demo shows specific feature, not vague claims

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```
{
  output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
  scripts: [
    {
      platform: string          # "tiktok" | "reels" | "shorts"
      duration_seconds: number  # 45
      hook_style: string        # "demo_first"
      scenes: [
        {
          timecode: string      # "0-3s"
          visual: string
          spoken: string
          text_overlay: string
        }
      ]
      caption: string           # Full TikTok caption
      hashtags: string[]        # Suggested hashtags
      disclosure: string        # How and when FTC disclosure appears
    }
  ]
  product_name: string
  content_angle: string
  hook_used: string
}
```

## Output Format

```
## TikTok Script: [Product Name] ([Duration]s)

**Hook Style:** [Style name]
**Platform:** [TikTok / Reels / Shorts]
**Target Audience:** [Who this is for]


### Caption

[Full caption text — optimized for TikTok SEO]

**Hashtags:** #[tag1] #[tag2] #[tag3] (5-8 tags max)


### Hook Alternatives

Want a different opening? Try:
- **[Hook Style 2]:** "[Alternative opening line]"
- **[Hook Style 3]:** "[Alternative opening line]"
```

## Error Handling

- **No product info:** Ask what product they're promoting. If they came from S1, pull
  `recommended_program` from context.
- **Product isn't visual / hard to demo:** Shift to reaction/testimonial format —
  creator's face on screen reacting to the tool, narrating the discovery.
- **User has no product access:** Write a "third-person discovery" script —
  "My friend showed me this tool and I had to share it"
- **Duration feels too long for the content:** Cut the demo to single strongest moment.
  If 30s still feels crowded, suggest two separate videos (problem setup + solution).
- **Platform unspecified:** Default to TikTok. Mention Reels and Shorts are the same script
  with minor caption/hashtag adjustments.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
User: "Write a 45-second TikTok script for HeyGen"
→ Research: HeyGen creates AI avatar videos, talking head from text
→ Hook: Demo first — open with a finished AI video playing
→ Script: [0-3s] Show output video → [3-8s] "Made this in 2 minutes, no camera" →
  [8-30s] Screen record: paste script → avatar speaks → [30-38s] "Used this for
  my client, saved 4 hours" → [38-44s] "Link in bio, 30-day free trial" → [44-45s] "#ad overlay"

**Example 2:**
User: "TikTok script for Notion affiliate, targeting students"
→ Hook: Relatable — "POV: it's 2am before finals and your notes are chaos"
→ Demo: Notion AI organizing scattered notes into a study guide
→ CTA: "Free forever plan — link in bio"
→ Caption: "study with me + notion hacks" for algorithm reach

**Example 3:**
User: "I need 3 different hooks for a ConvertKit TikTok script"
→ Write hook-only variants: Question / Shock / Bold Claim
→ Full script for the strongest one, alternative openings for others
→ Note which hook style historically performs best for SaaS on TikTok

## Revenue & Action Plan

### Expected Outcomes
- **Revenue potential**: TikTok affiliate videos average 1-3% bio link click rate. A video with 10,000 views = 100-300 bio link clicks. At 2% conversion and $50 commission = $100-300 per viral video
- **Benchmark**: Top TikTok affiliates report $500-2,000/month from 3-5 videos per week. The algorithm rewards consistency — your 10th video performs better than your 1st
- **Key metric to track**: Bio link clicks per video (use a link-in-bio tool with click tracking like Beacons or your own bio-link page from `bio-link-deployer`)

### Do This Right Now (15 min)
1. **Film the script TODAY** — don't wait. The script is ready, your phone is the camera
2. Screen-record the product demo section (the hardest part to improvise)
3. Post on TikTok, then cross-post to Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts (3 platforms, 1 video)
4. Add your affiliate link to your bio before posting

### Track Your Results
After 5 videos, check: which hook style got the highest completion rate? Which video drove the most bio link clicks? Use that hook style for your next 5 videos.

> **Next step — copy-paste this prompt:**
> "Schedule my TikTok content for the next 30 days" → runs `social-media-scheduler`

## Flywheel Connections

### Feeds Into
- `social-media-scheduler` (S5) — scripts ready to schedule for filming/posting
- `content-pillar-atomizer` (S2) — successful scripts become content to atomize further

### Fed By
- `trending-content-scout` (S1) — top TikTok content + engagement data + winning hooks
- `content-angle-ranker` (S1) — recommended angle with format, hook, and parameters
- `affiliate-program-search` (S1) — `recommended_program` product data
- `purple-cow-audit` (S1) — remarkable angles for script hooks
- `content-pillar-atomizer` (S2) — atomized TikTok scripts from pillar content

### Feedback Loop
- Video view count and completion rate reveal which hook styles work → optimize hook selection

## Quality Gate

Before delivering output, verify:

1. Would I share this on MY personal social?
2. Contains specific, surprising detail? (not generic)
3. Respects reader's intelligence?
4. Remarkable enough to share? (Purple Cow test)
5. Irresistible offer framing? (if S4 offer skills ran)

Any NO → rewrite before delivering.

## Volume Mode

When `mode: "volume"`:
- Generate 5-10 hook variations for the same product
- Prioritize speed + variety over perfection
- Tag each with variant ID for A/B tracking
- Let data pick the winner

```yaml

# Keyword Cluster Architect

Map 50-200+ keywords into topical clusters grouped by search intent. Build a content roadmap for dominating a topic with hub-and-spoke architecture. Google rewards topical authority — this skill builds the strategic map that tells you exactly what content to create and in what order.

## Stage

S3: Blog & SEO — This is the strategic planning layer FOR blog content. Before writing individual posts, you need a map of the entire keyword landscape organized into clusters.

## When to Use

- User wants to plan SEO content strategy for a niche
- User asks about keyword research, clustering, or topical authority
- User says "keyword", "SEO plan", "content roadmap", "topic cluster", "hub and spoke"
- Before running `affiliate-blog-builder` — to know WHICH articles to write
- After `monopoly-niche-finder` — to map the keyword universe for the winning niche

## Input Schema

```yaml
niche: string                 # REQUIRED — the topic to cluster
                              # e.g., "AI video tools", "email marketing for SaaS"

seed_keywords: string[]       # OPTIONAL — starting keywords to expand from
                              # Default: auto-generated from niche

depth: string                 # OPTIONAL — "quick" (50 keywords) | "standard" (100) | "deep" (200+)
                              # Default: "standard"

affiliate_products: string[]  # OPTIONAL — products you promote (to prioritize commercial keywords)
                              # Default: none
```

**Chaining from S1 monopoly-niche-finder**: Use `monopoly_niche.intersection` as the `niche` input.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Seed Keywords

If not provided, generate 5-10 seed keywords from the niche:
- Product-focused: "[product] review", "best [category]"
- Problem-focused: "how to [solve problem]", "[problem] solution"
- Comparison: "[product A] vs [product B]", "alternatives to [product]"
- Tutorial: "how to use [product]", "[product] tutorial"

### Step 2: Expand Keywords

For each seed, use `web_search` to discover related keywords:
1. Search: `"[seed keyword]"` — note related searches, People Also Ask
2. Search: `"[seed keyword] guide" OR "[seed keyword] tutorial"` — informational variants
3. Search: `"best [seed keyword]" OR "[seed keyword] review"` — commercial variants

Collect 50-200+ unique keywords depending on `depth`.

### Step 3: Classify by Intent

Read `shared/references/seo-strategy.md` for clustering methodology.

Classify each keyword:
- **Informational** (I): Learning, how-to, what-is → blog posts, tutorials
- **Commercial** (C): Comparing, evaluating, reviewing → comparison posts, reviews
- **Transactional** (T): Ready to buy, pricing, discount → landing pages, deal pages
- **Navigational** (N): Brand-specific, login → skip (not your traffic to capture)

### Step 4: Cluster by Topic

Group keywords that share the same search intent (would be answered by the same page):

```
Cluster: "[Main Topic]"
  Type: [I/C/T]
  Hub keyword: [highest volume keyword]
  Supporting keywords:
    - [keyword 1] — [est. volume]
    - [keyword 2] — [est. volume]
  Content type: [blog post / comparison / review / tutorial / landing page]
  Priority: [1-5 based on volume × intent × competition]
```

### Step 5: Build Content Roadmap

Organize clusters into a hub-and-spoke map:

1. Identify the hub page (broadest, highest-volume cluster)
2. Connect spoke pages (specific clusters that link back to hub)
3. Prioritize by: commercial intent first (revenue), then informational (traffic)
4. Estimate effort: number of articles needed, suggested publishing cadence

### Step 6: Self-Validation

- [ ] Clusters are based on actual search data, not guesses
- [ ] Each cluster has a clear search intent (I, C, or T)
- [ ] Hub-and-spoke structure is logical (hub is broad, spokes are specific)
- [ ] Priority ordering makes business sense (revenue-driving content first)
- [ ] Total content pieces are realistic for user's capacity

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"

```

## Output Format

```
## Keyword Cluster Map: [Niche]

### Overview
- **Total keywords:** XXX
- **Clusters:** XX
- **Hub topic:** [main hub]
- **Content pieces needed:** XX articles

### Hub & Spoke Map
```
           [HUB: Main Topic]
          /    |    |    \
     [Spoke] [Spoke] [Spoke] [Spoke]
       |       |       |       |
     [Sub]   [Sub]   [Sub]   [Sub]
```

### Clusters by Priority

#### Priority 1: [Cluster Name] (Commercial Intent)
- **Hub keyword:** [keyword] — [volume]
- **Content type:** [comparison / review]
- **Keywords:** [list]
- **Article idea:** [specific title]

#### Priority 2: [Cluster Name] (Informational Intent)
[same structure]

[Continue for all clusters]

### Content Roadmap
| Week | Cluster | Article | Intent | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [cluster] | [title] | C | 1 |
| 2 | [cluster] | [title] | C | 1 |
| 3 | [cluster] | [title] | I | 2 |

### Next Steps
- Run `content-moat-calculator` to estimate effort for topical authority
- Run `affiliate-blog-builder` for Priority 1 articles
- Run `comparison-post-writer` for commercial clusters
```

## Error Handling

- **Niche too broad**: "This niche is very broad. Let me narrow to a sub-niche for more actionable clusters. Or run `monopoly-niche-finder` first."
- **No search volume**: "This niche may be too narrow for significant search traffic. Consider broadening slightly."
- **Too many keywords**: Group aggressively into fewer clusters. Quality of clustering > quantity of keywords.
- **No commercial intent keywords**: Flag as concern — hard to monetize through affiliate without commercial intent. Suggest adjacent niches.

## Examples

**Example 1:** "Map keywords for AI video tools"
→ Seeds: "best AI video tools", "AI video generator", "HeyGen review". Expand to 100+ keywords. Cluster: "AI video reviews" (C), "how to make AI videos" (I), "AI video pricing" (T), "AI video vs traditional" (C). Hub: "Best AI Video Tools 2025".

**Example 2:** "Keyword strategy for my affiliate blog about email marketing"
→ Deep keyword research. Clusters: "email marketing platforms" (C), "email automation tutorials" (I), "email marketing pricing comparison" (T), "email deliverability guides" (I).

**Example 3:** "Plan my content roadmap" (after monopoly-niche-finder)
→ Pick up niche from chain. Map 100+ keywords in that intersection niche. Prioritize clusters by revenue potential.

## Flywheel Connections

### Feeds Into
- `affiliate-blog-builder` (S3) — which articles to write and target keywords
- `comparison-post-writer` (S3) — commercial clusters become comparison articles
- `content-moat-calculator` (S3) — keyword count informs moat estimation
- `landing-page-creator` (S4) — transactional clusters become landing pages
- `internal-linking-optimizer` (S6) — cluster structure defines link architecture

### Fed By
- `monopoly-niche-finder` (S1) — niche to cluster keywords for
- `content-pillar-atomizer` (S2) — content pillars suggest keyword areas
- `seo-audit` (S6) — current ranking data reveals keyword gaps

### Feedback Loop
- `seo-audit` (S6) reveals ranking gaps in existing clusters → add keywords and new content to fill gaps

## Quality Gate

Before delivering output, verify:

1. Would I share this on MY personal social?
2. Contains specific, surprising detail? (not generic)
3. Respects reader's intelligence?
4. Remarkable enough to share? (Purple Cow test)
5. Irresistible offer framing? (roadmap feels actionable)

Any NO → rewrite before delivering.

## 39. Expert Skill: comparison-post-writer
> **Path within category:** `skills/blog/comparison-post-writer/SKILL.md`


# Comparison Post Writer

Write high-converting "X vs Y" comparison blog posts that rank on Google and help readers make a confident buying decision. Each post includes a feature comparison table, individual product breakdowns, pros and cons, a clear winner recommendation, and affiliate CTAs placed at maximum-intent moments.

## When to Use

- User wants to compare two or three competing products side by side
- User has two affiliate programs and wants a single article that covers both
- User says "vs", "versus", "compare", "which is better", "side by side"
- User wants to capture high-intent search traffic (X vs Y searches convert at 2-3x the rate of generic reviews)
- User has a product from S1 and wants to frame it against competitors

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Products to Compare

Parse the user's request for product names. You need a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 3 products.

**If only 1 product is provided:**
- Use `web_search` to find the top 1-2 competitors
- Search: `"[product name] alternatives" OR "[product name] vs" site:g2.com OR site:capterra.com OR site:trustradius.com`
- Pick the competitors with the most head-to-head search volume

**If 3+ products are provided:**
- Keep all 3 if they are genuinely comparable
- If the user listed 4+, ask which 2-3 to focus on — more than 3 makes the comparison unwieldy

**Affiliate priority**: The user's affiliate product goes first (featured position). If both products have affiliate links, feature the higher-commission one in the "winner" slot unless the product genuinely loses on quality.

### Step 2: Research Both Products

For each product, use `web_search` to gather:
1. **Pricing**: starting price, tiers, free trial availability
2. **Key features**: 8-12 features that matter to buyers
3. **Target audience**: who uses this product and why
4. **Known weaknesses**: common complaints on G2, Capterra, Reddit, or Trustpilot
5. **Unique differentiator**: one thing this product does better than everyone else
6. **Search volume signal**: `"[product A] vs [product B]"` — check if autocomplete shows this is a real query

Search queries to run per product:
- `"[product name] review [year]"`
- `"[product name] pricing"`
- `"[product name] pros cons"`

### Step 3: Build the Comparison Framework

Determine the 6-10 comparison dimensions that matter most for this product category. These should be:
- Directly relevant to buyer decisions (not vanity features)
- Measurable or clearly differentiable between products
- Things that appear in search queries ("does X have [feature]?")

**Example dimensions by category:**
- Email tools: deliverability, automation, templates, integrations, pricing/contacts ratio, free plan
- SEO tools: keyword database size, backlink data, site audit depth, reporting, API access, pricing
- Video tools: resolution, AI avatars, voice cloning, templates, render speed, watermark on free plan
- Project management: task limits on free, Gantt chart, time tracking, automations, integrations, mobile app

Assign a winner per dimension based on research. Mark ties where genuine.

### Step 4: Determine the Narrative Angle

Choose one of three angles based on what the data shows:

| Angle | When to use | Headline formula |
|---|---|---|
| **Clear winner** | One product is genuinely better for most users | "[A] vs [B]: [A] Wins for Most, But [B] Is Better If..." |
| **It depends** | Products serve different audiences | "[A] vs [B]: Which Is Right for You? (Honest Comparison)" |
| **Upset** | Lesser-known product beats the market leader | "[A] vs [B]: Why [Lesser-Known] Is Actually Better in [Year]" |

Default to "clear winner" — readers want a recommendation, not a non-answer.

### Step 5: Write the Article

Write the full comparison post following this exact structure:

**1. FTC Disclosure** (3 lines, above the fold)
Read `shared/references/ftc-compliance.md` and use the medium format. Insert immediately after the title.

**2. Introduction** (150-250 words)
- Open with the core tension: why this is a hard choice
- State who each product is best suited for (one sentence each)
- End with: "By the end of this post, you'll know exactly which one to pick."
- Include target keyword naturally in the first 100 words

**3. Quick Verdict Box** (immediately after intro)
A scannable summary for readers who won't read the full article:
```
**Quick Verdict**
- Best overall: [Product A] — [one-line reason]
- Best for [use case]: [Product B] — [one-line reason]
- Best for budget: [Product X]
- Skip if: [edge case where neither works]
```

**4. Product Overviews** (200-300 words each)
One H2 section per product:
- What it is and what it does
- Who built it and when (brief credibility context)
- The one thing it does better than anyone else
- Starting price and free trial info
- Affiliate CTA: `[Try [Product] free →](affiliate_url)`

**5. Feature Comparison Table**
A full markdown table with all comparison dimensions:
```
| Feature | [Product A] | [Product B] |
|---|---|---|
| [Dimension 1] | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| [Dimension 2] | ⭐ Better | Good |
| Price | $X/mo | $Y/mo |
```
Use ✅ / ❌ / ⚠️ (partial) for binary features. Use descriptive text for nuanced ones. Bold the winner per row.

**6. Deep-Dive Sections** (one H2 per key dimension, 3-4 total)
Pick the 3-4 dimensions that drive 80% of buying decisions. For each:
- Explain what the feature does and why it matters
- Compare both products specifically (not generically)
- Include a sub-verdict: "Winner: [Product] because..."

**7. Pricing Breakdown**
- Table showing all pricing tiers for both products
- Calculate cost at 3 usage levels: starter, growing, scale
- Highlight free plan differences
- Note which has better value per feature

**8. Pros and Cons**
Two H3 sections (one per product), each with 4-6 bullet points per list.

**9. Who Should Choose Each Product**
Two H3 sections with bullet lists:
- "Choose [Product A] if you..."
- "Choose [Product B] if you..."
Be specific — job titles, use cases, budget ranges, team sizes.

**10. The Verdict** (200-300 words)
- State the winner clearly: "[Product A] is the better choice for most people."
- Explain why in 2-3 sentences
- Acknowledge the exception case where [Product B] wins
- Final affiliate CTA (strong format): `**Get started with [Product A] →**(affiliate_url)`
- If [Product B] also has affiliate link: secondary CTA below

**11. FAQ Section** (5-7 questions)
Address the real questions people type into Google:
- "Is [Product A] better than [Product B]?"
- "Which is cheaper, [A] or [B]?"
- "Does [Product A] offer a free trial?"
- "Can I switch from [Product B] to [Product A]?"
- "Which has better customer support?"

### Step 6: Format Output

Produce output in three parts:

**Part 1: SEO Metadata**
```
Title: [title]
Slug: [product-a]-vs-[product-b]
Meta Description: [150-160 chars comparing both products with clear angle]
Target Keyword: [product-a] vs [product-b]
Secondary Keywords: [product-a] review, [product-b] alternatives, best [category] tool, [product-a] pricing
Word Count: [actual]
Format: comparison
Winner: [product name]

## 40. Expert Skill: listicle-generator
> **Path within category:** `skills/blog/listicle-generator/SKILL.md`


# Listicle Generator

Write "Top N Best [Category]" roundup articles that rank on Google, capture featured snippets, and drive affiliate conversions across multiple products. Each list entry is a self-contained mini-review with features, pricing, pros/cons, audience fit, and a CTA. The article is structured to win both the featured snippet and the "People Also Ask" box.

## When to Use

- User wants to cover an entire product category with multiple affiliate links
- User says "best", "top", "roundup", "list of", or mentions a number with a category
- User wants to capture high-volume generic keywords ("best email marketing tools") vs. specific product searches
- User has multiple affiliate programs in the same category and wants one article to cover them all
- User wants an article format that benefits from regular updates (add/remove products as market evolves)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine List Parameters

Parse the user's request for:
- **Category**: what type of product (e.g., "email marketing tools", "AI video generators")
- **List size (N)**: explicitly stated number, or auto-select based on category depth
  - Niche/specialized categories: 5-7 products
  - Broad/competitive categories: 7-10 products
  - Very broad (e.g., "project management tools"): 10-12 products
- **Target audience**: inferred from category + any context clues (beginners, enterprises, specific industries)
- **Year**: always use current year in the title for freshness signal

**If no affiliate product is specified:**
- Ask: "Which product are you promoting? I'll feature it prominently in the list."
- If user says to proceed anyway, generate a balanced list and note where they should insert their affiliate link.

### Step 2: Research the Product Landscape

Use `web_search` to build the product list:

1. **Seed query**: `"best [category] tools [year]" site:g2.com OR site:capterra.com OR site:trustradius.com`
2. **Validate with traffic**: `"best [category]"` — check autocomplete for common phrasings
3. **Find affiliate programs**: `"[category] affiliate program"` — identify which products offer commissions

For each candidate product, gather:
- Product name and one-line description
- Starting price and free plan availability
- G2/Capterra rating (if available)
- The one thing it does best (unique angle)
- Who it's primarily designed for

**Affiliate prioritization rules:**
- Position the user's affiliate product at #1 or #2 (never lower than #3 unless it genuinely cannot be defended in the top 3)
- #1 position gets the most clicks — use it for the highest-commission or best-converting product
- If the user has multiple affiliate programs, spread them in positions 1, 2, and 4
- Non-affiliate products fill the remaining slots to make the list credible and balanced

### Step 3: Plan the Article Structure

Map out every section before writing:

**Article structure:**
1. Title (with year, number, category)
2. FTC disclosure
3. Introduction (150-200 words)
4. "At a Glance" summary table
5. Evaluation criteria (H2)
6. Individual product entries × N (H2 each)
7. Comparison table (all products × key dimensions)
8. How to Choose (H2)
9. FAQ (H2)
10. Final Recommendation (H2)

**Per-entry structure** (400-600 words each):
- H2: `[Rank]. [Product Name] — [One-line Value Prop]`
- Opening paragraph: what it is, who made it, why it's on this list
- Key features section (3-5 bullet points)
- Pricing table (free / starter / pro / enterprise)
- Pros list (4-5 bullets)
- Cons list (2-3 bullets — be honest, builds trust)
- Best for: one sentence naming the ideal user
- Affiliate CTA button: `[Try [Product] free →](url)`

### Step 4: Write the Full Article

**Title formula:** `[N] Best [Category] Tools in [Year] (Ranked and Reviewed)`
Alternative: `Best [Category] Software: Top [N] Picks for [Year]`

**Introduction (150-200 words):**
- Open with the core problem this category solves
- Mention how many tools you evaluated and your selection criteria
- Name-drop 2-3 products from the list to signal comprehensiveness
- End with a transition: "Here are the [N] best options I found."

**"At a Glance" Table** (immediately after intro, captures featured snippet):
```
| Tool | Best For | Starting Price | Free Plan |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Product 1] | [Use case] | $X/mo | ✅ |
| [Product 2] | [Use case] | $Y/mo | ❌ |
```

**Evaluation Criteria (H2, before the list):**
List the 4-6 criteria used to rank products. This builds credibility and explains why your #1 pick is #1.
Example criteria: ease of use, feature depth, pricing value, customer support quality, integration ecosystem, scalability.

**Individual Product Entries:**
Write each entry following the per-entry structure above. Vary the opening sentence — don't start every entry the same way. Include specific, verifiable details (actual feature names, real pricing tiers, concrete limitations) — not generic praise.

**Master Comparison Table:**
After all product entries, include a comprehensive feature matrix:
```
| Feature | [P1] | [P2] | [P3] | [P4] | [P5] |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Free plan | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| [Key feature] | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| [Key feature] | ⭐ Best | Good | Limited | Good | Basic |
| Starting price | $X | $Y | $Z | $A | Free |
```

**How to Choose (H2, 300-400 words):**
A decision framework for readers who are still unsure after reading the list:
- "If you're a beginner with a tight budget → [Product X]"
- "If you need [specific feature] → [Product Y]"
- "If you're scaling a team → [Product Z]"
- "If you're migrating from [common competitor] → [Product A]"

**FAQ Section (5-7 questions):**
- "What is the best [category] tool?"
- "What is the cheapest [category] tool?"
- "What [category] tool has the best free plan?"
- "Is [top product] worth it?"
- "How do I choose [category] software?"

**Final Recommendation (H2):**
- Restate the #1 pick with a 2-sentence reason
- Give a backup pick for a different audience
- Strong CTA: `**Start with [Product] — it's free to try.** [Get started →](affiliate_url)`

### Step 5: Format Output

**Part 1: SEO Metadata**
```
Title: [title with year and number]
Slug: best-[category-slug]-tools
Meta Description: [150-160 chars, include number + year + top product name]
Target Keyword: best [category] tools
Secondary Keywords: [category] software, [product 1] review, [product 2] alternatives, top [category] [year]
Word Count: [actual]
Format: listicle
Products: [N]

## 41. Expert Skill: content-moat-calculator
> **Path within category:** `skills/blog/content-moat-calculator/SKILL.md`


# Content Moat Calculator

Estimate the total content investment needed to establish topical authority in a niche. Analyzes competitors' content volume and quality to give you a go/no-go decision before investing months of work. Answers the question: "How many pages do I need to dominate this topic?"

## Stage

S3: Blog & SEO — This decides what blog content to build. It's the feasibility check that saves you from starting a content strategy you can't finish.

## When to Use

- User is deciding whether to invest in a niche/topic
- User asks "how many articles do I need to rank?"
- User wants to understand the content investment required
- User says "content moat", "topical authority", "feasibility", "content gap"
- After `keyword-cluster-architect` to estimate effort for the planned clusters
- Before committing to a major content initiative

## Input Schema

```yaml
niche: string                 # REQUIRED — the topic to analyze
                              # e.g., "AI video tools", "email marketing for SaaS"

hub_keyword: string           # OPTIONAL — main keyword to analyze competitors for
                              # Default: inferred from niche

your_current_pages: number    # OPTIONAL — how many pages you already have on this topic
                              # Default: 0

publishing_capacity: string   # OPTIONAL — "1/week" | "2/week" | "3/week" | "5/week"
                              # Default: "2/week"
```

**Chaining from S3 keyword-cluster-architect**: Use `keyword_clusters.total_clusters` and `keyword_clusters.hub.keyword`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Top Competitors

Read `shared/references/seo-strategy.md` for moat calculation methodology.

1. `web_search` for `[hub_keyword]` or main niche keyword
2. Identify top 5 ranking sites (exclude giants like Wikipedia, Reddit)
3. For each competitor:
   - `web_search`: `site:[competitor.com] [niche topic]` — count pages on this topic
   - Note: content depth (word count), content freshness (publish dates), content types (blog, comparison, tutorial)

### Step 2: Calculate Moat

```
Average competitor pages = sum(competitor_pages) / number_of_competitors
Your moat target = Average × 1.5 (need MORE than average to break through)
Content gap = Moat target - your_current_pages
```

### Step 3: Feasibility Assessment

Based on moat target and publishing capacity:

```
Weeks to moat = Content gap / publishing_capacity_per_week
```

| Moat Target | Assessment | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| < 20 pages | GREEN — Achievable | Go for it. 2-3 months at 2/week. |
| 20-50 pages | YELLOW — Significant | Commit or don't. 3-6 months at 2/week. |
| 50-100 pages | ORANGE — Major investment | Consider narrowing niche. 6-12 months. |
| 100+ pages | RED — Very high barrier | Find a sub-niche or different angle. |

### Step 4: Competitive Advantage Analysis

Identify ways to build moat FASTER:
1. **Quality over quantity**: Can you beat thin content with fewer, deeper pages?
2. **Unique data**: Can you add proprietary data competitors don't have? (→ `proprietary-data-generator`)
3. **Format advantage**: Can you use formats competitors don't? (video, interactive, tools)
4. **Update velocity**: Can you refresh content faster than competitors?

### Step 5: Timeline and Roadmap

Create realistic timeline:
- Phase 1: Foundation content (hub + core spokes)
- Phase 2: Supporting content (additional spokes, long-tail)
- Phase 3: Authority content (original research, data, comprehensive guides)
- Phase 4: Maintenance (refresh, update, expand)

### Step 6: Self-Validation

- [ ] Competitor analysis uses real data (not estimates)
- [ ] Moat calculation is transparent and logical
- [ ] Feasibility assessment is honest (not overly optimistic)
- [ ] Competitive advantages are realistic
- [ ] Timeline accounts for quality, not just quantity

## Output Schema

- **Your current pages:** XX
- **Content gap:** XX pages
- **At [X]/week:** XX weeks to moat

### Feasibility: [GREEN/YELLOW/ORANGE/RED]

[Assessment paragraph — honest, actionable]

### Competitive Advantages
1. [How to build moat faster]
2. [What competitors are missing]

### Timeline
| Phase | Content | Pages | Weeks |
|---|---|---|---|
| Foundation | Hub + core spokes | XX | X |
| Supporting | Long-tail, tutorials | XX | X |
| Authority | Original research, data | XX | X |
| **Total** | | **XX** | **X** |

### Recommendation
[Clear go/no-go with reasoning]
```

## Error Handling

- **Can't find competitors**: Broaden the search. If still no competitors → great sign (blue ocean), estimate moat at 15-20 pages.
- **Niche too broad**: "This niche has too many competitors to analyze meaningfully. Narrow down — run `monopoly-niche-finder` first."
- **User has significant existing content**: Factor in existing pages. May already be at moat → focus on gaps and freshness.
- **All competitors are massive sites**: Recommend niching down. You can't outproduce Forbes — but you can out-specialize them.

## Examples

**Example 1:** "How much content do I need to dominate AI video tools?"
→ Analyze top 5 sites ranking for "best AI video tools". Average 35 pages. Moat = 53 pages. At 2/week = 27 weeks. YELLOW — significant but doable.

**Example 2:** "Can I compete in email marketing?"
→ Analyze competitors. Average 200+ pages. Moat = 300 pages. RED — too broad. Suggest: "email marketing for Shopify stores" (moat = 25 pages, GREEN).

**Example 3:** "Content moat for my keyword clusters" (after keyword-cluster-architect)
→ Use cluster data to estimate pages needed per cluster. Compare against competitors per cluster. Identify which clusters are GREEN vs RED.

- `keyword-cluster-architect` (S3) — cluster count informs moat estimation
- `seo-audit` (S6) — current content performance data
- `performance-report` (S6) — content performance metrics

### Feedback Loop
- `performance-report` (S6) tracks progress toward moat target → celebrate milestones, adjust strategy if falling behind

## Quality Gate

Before delivering output, verify:

1. Would I share this on MY personal social?
2. Contains specific, surprising detail? (not generic)
3. Respects reader's intelligence?
4. Remarkable enough to share? (Purple Cow test)
5. Irresistible offer framing? (assessment feels actionable)

Any NO → rewrite before delivering.

# Affiliate Blog Builder

Write full SEO-optimized blog articles that rank on Google and drive passive affiliate revenue. Supports four formats: product review, head-to-head comparison, best-of listicle, and how-to guide. Each article includes keyword strategy, structured headings, comparison tables, CTAs, FAQ schema, and FTC-compliant disclosure.

## Stage

S3: Blog — The highest-value content type in the affiliate funnel. Blog articles rank on Google, drive organic traffic for months/years, and convert at higher rates than social posts because readers have high purchase intent.

## When to Use

- User wants to write a blog post reviewing an affiliate product
- User wants a comparison article (Product A vs Product B)
- User wants a "best of" listicle for a product category
- User wants a how-to tutorial that naturally promotes an affiliate product
- User has a product from S1 (affiliate-program-search) and wants to create long-form content
- User says anything like "write a blog", "SEO article", "product review post", "roundup post"

## Input Schema

```yaml
product:                    # REQUIRED — the affiliate product to feature
  name: string              # Product name (e.g., "HeyGen")
  description: string       # What it does
  reward_value: string      # Commission (e.g., "30% recurring")
  url: string               # Affiliate link URL
  reward_type: string       # "recurring" | "one-time" | "tiered"
  cookie_days: number       # Cookie duration
  tags: string[]            # e.g., ["ai", "video", "saas"]

format: string              # OPTIONAL — "review" | "comparison" | "listicle" | "how-to"
                            # Default: "listicle" (highest traffic potential)

compare_with: object[]      # OPTIONAL — competitors for comparison/listicle formats
  - name: string            # Competitor name
    description: string     # Brief description
    url: string             # URL (non-affiliate OK)
    pricing: string         # Starting price

target_keyword: string      # OPTIONAL — primary SEO keyword to target
                            # Default: auto-generated from product name + category

blog_platform: string       # OPTIONAL — "wordpress" | "ghost" | "hugo" | "astro" | "webflow" | "markdown"
                            # Default: "markdown" (universal)

tone: string                # OPTIONAL — "professional" | "conversational" | "technical"
                            # Default: "conversational"

word_count_target: number   # OPTIONAL — override default word count for the format
```

**Chaining from S1**: If `affiliate-program-search` was run earlier in the conversation, automatically pick up `recommended_program` from its output as the `product` input. The field mapping:
- `recommended_program.name` → `product.name`
- `recommended_program.description` → `product.description`
- `recommended_program.reward_value` → `product.reward_value`
- `recommended_program.url` → `product.url`
- `recommended_program.reward_type` → `product.reward_type`
- `recommended_program.cookie_days` → `product.cookie_days`
- `recommended_program.tags` → `product.tags`

If the user says "now write a blog about it" after running S1 — use the recommended program. No need to ask again.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Format

Choose the article format based on user request or defaults:

| Signal | Format |
|---|---|
| User says "review", "my experience with" | `review` |
| User mentions two+ products, "vs", "compare" | `comparison` |
| User says "best", "top", "roundup", numbers | `listicle` |
| User says "how to", "tutorial", "guide", "step by step" | `how-to` |
| No clear signal | `listicle` (default — highest traffic potential) |

If `format = comparison` and `compare_with` is empty or has only 1 product:
- Use `web_search` to find 2-3 top competitors in the same category
- Search query: `"best alternatives to [product.name]" OR "[product.name] vs" site:g2.com OR site:capterra.com`

If `format = listicle` and `compare_with` is empty:
- Use `web_search` to find 4-6 products in the same category
- Search query: `"best [product category] tools [year]"`

### Step 2: SEO Framework

Read `references/seo-checklist.md` for the complete SEO guidelines. Then:

1. **Generate target keyword** (if not provided):
   - Review format: `[product name] review`
   - Comparison: `[product A] vs [product B]`
   - Listicle: `best [category] tools`
   - How-to: `how to [goal] with [product/category]`

2. **Generate secondary keywords** (3-5):
   - Use `web_search` for: `"[target keyword]" related searches` and "People Also Ask"
   - Include: `[product] pricing`, `[product] alternatives`, `[product] pros and cons`, `is [product] worth it`

3. **Build title** using the formula from seo-checklist.md matching the format

4. **Write meta description** (150-160 chars) following the checklist format

5. **Plan heading structure**:
   - Map out all H2/H3 headings before writing
   - Ensure target keyword appears in at least 2 H2s
   - Ensure secondary keywords appear in H3s
   - Follow the heading hierarchy from seo-checklist.md

6. **Generate slug** from target keyword (lowercase, hyphens, no stop words)

### Step 3: Write Article

Read `references/blog-templates.md` and use the template matching the chosen format. Then write the full article following these rules:

**Content Rules:**
- Follow the exact template structure for the chosen format
- Write in the specified `tone` (default: conversational)
- Hit the word count target for the format (review: 2-3.5K, comparison: 2.5-3.5K, listicle: 3-5K, how-to: 2-3K)
- Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)
- Include bullet points and numbered lists for scannability
- Write like a real person who has used the product — specific details, not generic fluff

**Required Sections (all formats):**
- FTC disclosure near the top — read `shared/references/ftc-compliance.md` and use the **medium** format
- Comparison table (at least one, even in reviews — compare to alternatives)
- Pros and cons for every recommended product
- "Who is this best for?" audience targeting
- Pricing information with affiliate CTA
- FAQ section (3-5 questions)
- Final verdict with clear recommendation and affiliate CTA

**Affiliate CTA Placement (2-4 per article):**
1. After the pricing section
2. After a key feature demonstration
3. In the final verdict
4. Optionally: in a callout box after the "who is this for" section

**CTA Formats:**
- Soft: `[Try [Product] free →]([affiliate_url])`
- Medium: `**Ready to get started?** [Sign up for [Product] →]([affiliate_url])`
- Strong (verdict only): `**Our recommendation**: [Get [Product] here]([affiliate_url]) — [brief value prop].`

**Things to AVOID:**
- No Affitor branding in the article body (this is the user's blog, not ours)
- No "AI-generated" disclaimers (the user will edit and personalize)
- No placeholder text like "[insert your experience here]" — write complete content. If personal experience is needed, write realistic example scenarios clearly marked as examples
- No keyword stuffing — natural language only
- No false claims about products

### Step 4: Format Output

Produce the final output in this exact structure:

**Part 1: SEO Metadata Block**
```
Title: [SEO title]
Slug: [url-slug]
Meta Description: [150-160 chars]
Target Keyword: [primary keyword]
Secondary Keywords: [comma-separated list]
Word Count: [actual count]
Format: [review/comparison/listicle/how-to]
SUPPLEMENTARY
```

### Step 5: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] Word count meets format target (review: 2-3.5K, comparison: 2.5-3.5K, listicle: 3-5K, how-to: 2-3K)
- [ ] FTC disclosure near top of article, medium format
- [ ] 2-4 CTAs placed at: after pricing, feature demo, verdict, optional callout box
- [ ] Meta description is 150-160 characters
- [ ] Target keyword appears naturally in first 100 words
- [ ] No placeholder text, no AI-generated disclaimers

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
article:
  title: string             # SEO-optimized title
  slug: string              # URL-friendly slug
  meta_description: string  # 150-160 character meta description
  target_keyword: string    # Primary keyword targeted
  format: string            # review | comparison | listicle | how-to
  content: string           # Full markdown article
  word_count: number        # Actual word count
  headings:                 # Article structure
    - level: number         # 2 for H2, 3 for H3
      text: string          # Heading text

seo:
  secondary_keywords: string[]    # 3-5 secondary keywords used
  faq_questions:                  # For FAQ schema markup
    - question: string
      answer: string
  image_suggestions:              # Recommended images
    - description: string         # What to screenshot/create
      alt_text: string            # SEO alt text
      placement: string           # After which section

products_featured:                # All products mentioned
  - name: string
    url: string                   # Affiliate URL
    role: string                  # "primary" | "compared" | "mentioned"
    reward_value: string          # Commission info
    pricing: string | null        # Starting price (e.g., "$49/mo") — for S4 landing page chaining
```

## Output Format

Present the output as a single markdown document with three clearly separated sections:
1. **SEO Metadata** — fenced block with all SEO settings for easy copy into WordPress/Yoast
2. **Article** — the full blog post in markdown, ready to paste
3. **Supplementary** — FAQ for schema markup, image suggestions, products list, and next steps

The article should be **immediately publishable** — not a draft or outline. The user should be able to copy-paste it into their blog editor, add their own screenshots and personal touches, and publish.

## Error Handling

- **No product provided**: "I need a product to write about. Run `/affiliate-program-search` first to find one, or tell me the product name and I'll research it."
- **Comparison with only 1 product**: Auto-search for 2-3 competitors using `web_search`. Search: `"best alternatives to [product]"` on G2/Capterra.
- **No compare_with for listicle**: Auto-search for 4-6 products in the category. Inform user: "I found these products to include — let me know if you want to swap any."
- **Unknown blog platform**: Default to markdown output. Add note: "This is universal markdown — works with WordPress, Ghost, Hugo, Astro, and most platforms."
- **Product has no public info**: Use `web_search` to research the product. If still insufficient: "I couldn't find enough information about [product] to write a credible article. Can you provide more details about features, pricing, and your experience?"
- **Controversial or questionable product**: Include balanced pros/cons. Add note: "This product has mixed reviews — make sure you've personally verified these claims before publishing."

## Examples

### Example 1: Product Review (chained from S1)
**User**: "Now write a detailed review of HeyGen for my blog"
**Context**: S1 previously returned HeyGen as recommended_program
**Action**: Auto-detect format=review, pick up HeyGen product data from S1 output, generate full review article targeting "heygen review" keyword.

### Example 2: Comparison Article
**User**: "Write a comparison blog post: HeyGen vs Synthesia vs Colossyan for AI video creation"
**Action**: Format=comparison, primary product=HeyGen (if from S1, else first mentioned), compare_with=[Synthesia, Colossyan], target keyword="heygen vs synthesia vs colossyan".

### Example 3: Listicle (Default Format)
**User**: "Write a blog post about the best AI video tools"
**Action**: Format=listicle (matches "best"), web_search for top AI video tools, target keyword="best ai video tools", write 3-5K word roundup with 5-7 products.

### Example 4: How-To Guide
**User**: "Write a tutorial blog post on how to create AI-generated videos for YouTube with HeyGen"
**Action**: Format=how-to (matches "tutorial", "how to"), target keyword="how to create ai videos for youtube", write step-by-step guide featuring HeyGen with affiliate CTAs.

### Example 5: Minimal Input
**User**: "Blog post about Semrush"
**Action**: No format specified → default to listicle? No — single product implies review. Use format=review, web_search Semrush for features/pricing/reviews, target keyword="semrush review", generate full article.

**Format detection logic for ambiguous cases**: If only one product is mentioned with no format keyword, default to `review`. If a category is mentioned with no specific product, default to `listicle`.

> **Path within category:** `skills/blog/how-to-tutorial-writer/SKILL.md`


# How-To Tutorial Writer

Write practical, step-by-step tutorial blog posts that solve a real reader problem and naturally recommend affiliate products as the best tool for the job. Uses the "problem → solution → tool" pattern: establish what the reader wants to do, show them exactly how to do it, and position the affiliate product as the right instrument for each step.

## When to Use

- User wants to create educational content that drives affiliate conversions indirectly
- User says "how to", "tutorial", "guide", "walkthrough", "step by step"
- User wants to rank for "how to [task]" keywords (high traffic, lower competition than "best" keywords)
- User has a product that is best understood through demonstration, not just description
- User wants to build authority and trust in a niche before making a sale

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define the Tutorial Goal

Parse the request to identify:
- **The task**: what the reader wants to accomplish (e.g., "create AI videos for YouTube")
- **The tool**: which affiliate product enables the task (e.g., HeyGen)
- **The audience**: who is asking this question (beginner / intermediate / advanced)
- **The end state**: what the reader will have built or achieved by the end

If the task is vague ("write a tutorial about HeyGen"), default to the most popular use case for that tool — search for it: `"[product name] tutorial" OR "how to use [product name]"` — pick the highest-traffic query.

**Tutorial types** — detect from user's phrasing:
| Signal | Type | Format |
|---|---|---|
| "How to get started", "beginners guide", "first time" | `quickstart` | 5-8 steps, 1,500-2,000 words |
| "Step by step", "complete guide", "full tutorial" | `deep-dive` | 8-15 steps, 2,500-3,500 words |
| "How to [specific feature]" | `feature-focus` | 5-8 steps on one feature, 1,500-2,000 words |
| "How to [goal] without [product]" → redirect to product | `problem-solution` | 6-10 steps, 2,000-2,500 words |

### Step 2: Research the Tutorial Content

Use `web_search` to gather:
1. The actual step-by-step process for accomplishing the task
2. Common mistakes or gotchas beginners encounter
3. Official documentation or help articles for the product
4. What the top-ranking tutorials already cover (identify gaps)

Search queries:
- `"how to [task] with [product]"` — understand existing guides
- `"[product] tutorial [year]"` — find current instructions
- `"[product] [feature] settings"` — get accurate step names
- `"[task] mistakes beginners make"` — find pain points to address

**Content accuracy rule**: Never invent product UI details. If unsure about a specific button name or menu path, describe the action generically ("navigate to the settings section") rather than naming something that may be wrong.

### Step 3: Plan the Tutorial Structure

Map every section before writing. A well-structured tutorial follows this flow:

**What readers need before starting (Prerequisites):**
- Account requirements (free plan vs. paid tier needed for tutorial steps)
- Technical requirements
- Assets they should have ready (images, scripts, data)

**The steps themselves:**
- Each step = one atomic action (not a cluster of actions)
- Steps should be numbered, not just bulleted
- Each step has: action verb headline + explanation + expected result
- Decision points get callout boxes: "If you see X, do Y instead"

**Affiliate integration points** (natural, not forced):
1. In the Prerequisites section: "You'll need a [Product] account. [Sign up free here →](url)"
2. At the step where the product's key feature is used: contextual CTA
3. After showing the final result: "You just did X with [Product]. Here's what else it can do: [affiliate CTA]"
4. In the "Next Steps" section at the end

**Rule**: Never interrupt a step sequence with a hard sell. CTAs belong at natural pause points — before the reader starts, after they finish a major phase, and at the very end.

### Step 4: Write the Full Tutorial

**Title formula:**
- `How to [Task] with [Product]: Step-by-Step Guide ([Year])`
- `How to [Task]: A Beginner's Guide Using [Product]`
- `[Goal]: How to [Task] in [N] Steps (Even If You're New to [Topic])`

**Introduction (150-200 words):**
- Open with the reader's problem/desire (not with "In this tutorial...")
- State the end result: "By the end, you'll have [specific output]"
- Mention how long it takes and what level of experience is needed
- One-sentence product intro: "[Product] is what makes this possible — here's how to use it."
- Affiliate CTA if they need to sign up before starting

**Prerequisites section:**
```
**What you need before starting:**
- A [Product] account (free plan works / Pro plan required for [specific feature])
  → [Create your free account →](affiliate_url)
- [Any other required tool/asset/knowledge]
- Estimated time: [X minutes]
```

**Step-by-Step Section:**
Write each step as:
```
## Step [N]: [Action Verb] + [What You're Doing]

[2-4 sentence explanation of what this step does and why it matters]

1. [Specific sub-action with exact UI element names where known]
2. [Next sub-action]
3. [Continue...]

**You should see:** [description of what the expected result looks like]

> **Note:** [Optional callout for a common mistake or alternative path]
```

**Result/Output Section:**
After all steps, show what the reader has built:
- Describe the final output in concrete terms
- Include what they can do with it now
- Contextual affiliate CTA: "Now that you've [achieved X], you can use [Product]'s [feature] to take it further."

**Troubleshooting Section** (optional, high SEO value):
3-5 common issues readers might hit:
- "Error: [X]" → "This usually means [Y]. Fix it by [Z]."
- "Step 4 doesn't work if [condition]" → "Instead, try [alternative]."

**Next Steps Section:**
- What to do with the result
- Related features of the product to explore next
- Related tutorials (if user has other content)
- Final strong affiliate CTA

**FAQ Section (4-6 questions):**
- "Do I need a paid plan for [product] to follow this tutorial?"
- "How long does [task] take?"
- "Can I do this without [product]?"
- "Is [product] free to use for [task]?"
- "What should I do if [common problem]?"

### Step 5: Format Output

**Part 1: SEO Metadata**
```
Title: [title]
Slug: how-to-[task-slug]
Meta Description: [150-160 chars — include "how to", the task, and product name]
Target Keyword: how to [task] with [product]
Secondary Keywords: [product] tutorial, [task] guide, how to [task] [year], [product] for beginners
Word Count: [actual]
Format: how-to
Steps: [N]

## 44. Expert Skill: content-decay-detector
> **Path within category:** `skills/blog/content-decay-detector/SKILL.md`


# Content Decay Detector

Monitor existing content for ranking drops and generate a prioritized refresh queue. Refreshing decaying content is the highest-ROI SEO activity — it's faster and cheaper than creating new content, and recovering a lost position is easier than earning a new one.

## Stage

S3: Blog & SEO — Blog maintenance and optimization. This skill keeps your existing content competitive and prevents rankings from silently eroding.

## When to Use

- User has existing blog content and wants to check for decay
- User notices traffic declining on specific pages
- User asks "what content needs updating?"
- User says "content decay", "ranking drops", "stale content", "refresh", "content audit"
- Monthly maintenance check — should run every 30 days on active blogs
- After `seo-audit` reveals declining pages

## Input Schema

```yaml
site_url: string              # REQUIRED — the site to audit
                              # e.g., "myblog.com", "example.com/blog"

content_list: object[]        # OPTIONAL — specific pages to check
  - url: string               # Page URL
    title: string             # Page title
    publish_date: string      # Original publish date
    last_updated: string      # Last update date
    target_keyword: string    # Primary keyword

check_competitors: boolean    # OPTIONAL — whether to check if competitors published fresher content
                              # Default: true

timeframe: string             # OPTIONAL — "30d" | "90d" | "6m" | "1y"
                              # Default: "90d"
```

**Chaining from S6 seo-audit**: Use `declining_pages` as the `content_list`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Content Data

If `content_list` not provided:
1. `web_search`: `site:[site_url]` — discover indexed pages
2. Identify the top 15-20 most important pages (by topic relevance)
3. For each page, note: title, URL, apparent publish/update date

### Step 2: Check for Decay Signals

Read `shared/references/seo-strategy.md` for decay signals and refresh methodology.

For each page:
1. `web_search` for the page's target keyword — check current ranking position
2. Look for decay signals:
   - **Outdated information**: Product features, pricing, dates mentioned
   - **Competitor freshness**: Newer, better content published by competitors
   - **Missing elements**: No images, no data, thin content compared to current SERP
   - **Broken patterns**: "2023" in a title when it's 2025+, discontinued products mentioned

### Step 3: Score Decay Priority

For each decaying page, assign priority:

| Factor | Score | Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue impact | 1-5 | Contains affiliate links + had traffic = high revenue impact |
| Decay severity | 1-5 | Major outdated info = 5, minor = 1 |
| Fix effort | 1-5 (inverted) | Easy fix = 5, full rewrite = 1 |
| Competitor threat | 1-5 | Competitor published better version = 5 |

**Priority = Revenue × Decay × Fix_Ease × Competitor_Threat** (normalized)

### Step 4: Generate Refresh Instructions

For each page in priority order, specify:
1. **What's decayed** — specific outdated elements
2. **What to update** — concrete changes to make
3. **What to add** — new sections, data, or elements competitors have
4. **Internal linking** — new pages to link to/from since original publish
5. **Estimated effort** — time to refresh

### Step 5: Self-Validation

- [ ] Decay signals are evidence-based (not guesses)
- [ ] Priority ordering makes business sense (revenue-impacting first)
- [ ] Refresh instructions are specific and actionable
- [ ] Effort estimates are realistic
- [ ] Not recommending refreshes for content that's performing fine

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"
content_decay:
  site: string
  pages_analyzed: number
  pages_decaying: number
  total_refresh_effort: string  # Estimated total hours

  decaying_pages:

## Output Format

```
## Content Decay Report: [Site]

### Summary
- **Pages analyzed:** XX
- **Pages decaying:** XX
- **Total refresh effort:** XX hours
- **Estimated traffic recovery:** XX%

### Priority Refresh Queue

#### P0 — Critical (do this week)

**[Page Title]** — [URL]
- Decay: [what's wrong]
- Action: [what to do]
- Effort: [time estimate]
- Impact: [expected result]

#### P1 — High (do this month)
[same structure]

#### P2 — Medium (schedule)
[same structure]

### Healthy Pages (no action needed)
- [Page] — still ranking, content fresh
- [Page] — recently updated

### Monthly Maintenance Schedule
- Week 1: Refresh P0 pages
- Week 2: Refresh P1 pages
- Week 3: Create new content for gaps found
- Week 4: Internal linking review
```

## Error Handling

- **No site URL**: "I need your blog URL to check for content decay. What's the site?"
- **Site has no indexed pages**: "I can't find indexed pages for this URL. Check that the site is public and indexed by search engines."
- **All content is fresh**: "Great news — no significant decay detected. Run this check again in 30 days."
- **Can't determine ranking positions**: Use available signals (content age, competitor freshness, outdated info) for prioritization.

## Examples

**Example 1:** "Check my blog for content decay"
→ Discover indexed pages, check each for decay signals, generate prioritized refresh queue with specific actions per page.

**Example 2:** "Which of my articles need updating?"
→ Analyze content list, identify outdated pricing, stale comparisons, missing new products. Rank by revenue impact.

**Example 3:** "Content decay check" (after seo-audit)
→ Pick up declining pages from seo-audit output. Deep-dive each with competitor analysis and specific refresh instructions.

## Flywheel Connections

### Feeds Into
- `affiliate-blog-builder` (S3) — refresh instructions for specific articles
- `internal-linking-optimizer` (S6) — decaying pages may need better internal links
- `keyword-cluster-architect` (S3) — content gaps revealed by decay analysis

### Fed By
- `seo-audit` (S6) — declining pages to investigate
- `internal-linking-optimizer` (S6) — pages with weak link structure may be decaying
- `performance-report` (S6) — traffic decline data

### Feedback Loop
- After refreshing, `seo-audit` (S6) tracks whether rankings recovered → measure refresh ROI, refine decay detection sensitivity

## Quality Gate

Before delivering output, verify:

1. Would I share this on MY personal social?
2. Contains specific, surprising detail? (not generic)
3. Respects reader's intelligence?
4. Remarkable enough to share? (Purple Cow test)
5. Irresistible offer framing? (refresh actions feel actionable)

Any NO → rewrite before delivering.

## 45. Expert Skill: proprietary-data-generator
> **Path within category:** `skills/automation/proprietary-data-generator/SKILL.md`


# Proprietary Data Generator

Create original surveys, benchmarks, and aggregated data that nobody else has. Proprietary data is the ultimate content moat — competitors can copy your writing style but they can't copy YOUR data. Automates the design and execution framework for data collection that feeds unique content angles.

## Stage

S7: Automation & Scale — Generating data at scale requires automation. This skill designs the collection system, not just one data point. Creates repeatable data assets that compound over time.

## When to Use

- User wants to create content that can't be replicated by competitors
- User asks about "original research", "surveys", "benchmarks", "proprietary data"
- User says "data moat", "unique data", "first-party data", "original statistics"
- After `content-moat-calculator` identifies the need for differentiated content
- User wants to build authority through data-driven content
- User wants to create linkable assets that earn backlinks naturally

## Input Schema

```yaml
niche: string                 # REQUIRED — topic area for data collection
                              # e.g., "AI video tools", "affiliate marketing"

data_type: string             # OPTIONAL — "survey" | "benchmark" | "aggregation" | "case_study"
                              # Default: recommend based on niche and resources

audience_access: string       # OPTIONAL — how you can reach respondents
                              # e.g., "email list of 500", "Reddit community", "Twitter followers"
                              # Default: suggest options

budget: string                # OPTIONAL — "zero" | "low" ($0-100) | "medium" ($100-500) | "high" ($500+)
                              # Default: "zero"

goal: string                  # OPTIONAL — "content_moat" | "backlink_magnet" | "authority" | "lead_gen"
                              # Default: "content_moat"
```

**Chaining from S3 content-moat-calculator**: Use `competitive_advantages` to identify data moat opportunities.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Data Opportunity

Analyze the niche for data gaps:
1. `web_search`: `"[niche] statistics 2025" OR "[niche] survey" OR "[niche] benchmark"` — what data already exists?
2. Identify gaps: what questions does the industry ask that nobody has answered with data?
3. `web_search`: `"[niche] reddit" "I wish I knew" OR "does anyone know"` — find unmet data needs

### Step 2: Design Data Collection

Based on `data_type` (or recommend the best fit):

**Survey Design:**
- 8-12 questions (shorter = higher completion)
- Mix: 70% multiple choice, 20% scale (1-5), 10% open-ended
- One "surprising" question that will generate headline-worthy data
- Target sample size: 100+ for credibility
- Distribution plan: where and how to reach respondents

**Benchmark Study:**
- Define metrics to measure (3-5)
- Data sources: public data, API calls, manual collection
- Collection methodology: how often, what tools
- Comparison framework: how to present findings

**Data Aggregation:**
- Sources to aggregate from (public databases, APIs, web scraping targets)
- Aggregation logic: how to combine and normalize
- Update frequency: one-time or recurring
- Visualization plan

**Case Study Collection:**
- Template for collecting stories (5-7 structured questions)
- Outreach template for requesting case studies
- Anonymization rules
- Minimum viable sample: 10+ cases

### Step 3: Create Collection Assets

Produce ready-to-use assets:
1. **Survey questions** (if survey) — complete question list with answer options
2. **Collection template** — spreadsheet structure or form layout
3. **Outreach template** — email/message to recruit respondents
4. **Data analysis plan** — how to turn raw data into insights
5. **Content plan** — how to present findings (blog post, infographic, report)

### Step 4: Design Automation

Create a repeatable system:
- Schedule: when to collect data (monthly, quarterly, annually)
- Tools: recommended platforms (Google Forms, Typeform, Airtable)
- Automation: how to automate collection and reporting
- Update process: how to refresh and republish with new data

### Step 5: Self-Validation

- [ ] Data gap is real (verified by search — nobody else has this data)
- [ ] Sample size is realistic given audience access
- [ ] Questions are unbiased and well-structured
- [ ] Collection method is feasible with stated budget
- [ ] Output content plan is specific (not just "write a blog post")
- [ ] Data is ethically collected (no scraping private data, survey has consent)

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"
proprietary_data:
  niche: string
  data_type: string
  data_gap: string              # What data doesn't exist yet
  headline_potential: string    # The "surprising finding" angle

  collection:
    method: string
    sample_target: number
    tools: string[]
    timeline: string
    budget_needed: string

    - type: string              # "blog" | "infographic" | "report" | "social"
      title: string
      skill_to_use: string     # Which skill creates this content

  data_assets: string[]        # Moat strengtheners for chaining

chain_metadata:
  skill_slug: "proprietary-data-generator"
  stage: "automation"
  timestamp: string
  suggested_next:
    - "affiliate-blog-builder"
    - "content-pillar-atomizer"
    - "content-moat-calculator"
```

## Output Format

```
## Proprietary Data Plan: [Niche]

### The Data Gap
**Nobody has answered:** [the question]
**Why it matters:** [why people care]
**Headline potential:** "[Surprising finding template]"

### Collection Design

**Type:** [Survey / Benchmark / Aggregation / Case Study]
**Target sample:** XX responses
**Timeline:** X weeks
**Budget:** $XX
**Tools:** [tools list]

### Survey Questions (or Collection Template)
1. [Question] — [answer type] — [why this question]
2. [Question] — [answer type] — [why this question]
...

### Outreach Template
Subject: [subject line]
[email/message body]

### Content Plan (what to publish from this data)
1. **Blog post:** "[Title]" → build with `affiliate-blog-builder`
2. **Social thread:** Key findings → atomize with `content-pillar-atomizer`
3. **Lead magnet:** Full report PDF → distribute with `squeeze-page-builder`

### Automation Schedule
- **Collection:** [frequency]
- **Analysis:** [when after collection]
- **Publication:** [when after analysis]
- **Update:** [when to re-run with fresh data]
```

## Error Handling

- **No niche provided**: "Tell me your niche and I'll find data gaps nobody else is filling."
- **No audience access**: Suggest free distribution channels: Reddit, Twitter, niche forums, ProductHunt. "You don't need an email list — Reddit alone can drive 100+ survey responses."
- **Zero budget**: Design everything with free tools (Google Forms, Google Sheets, manual aggregation). "The best proprietary data costs $0 — just your time and curiosity."
- **Niche already well-researched**: Dig deeper. "The broad stats exist, but nobody has [specific angle]. Let's own that."

## Examples

**Example 1:** "I want original data about AI video tools"
→ Design survey: "AI Video Tools Usage Survey 2025" — 10 questions about which tools, satisfaction, spend, use cases. Distribute on Reddit r/aivideo, Twitter, LinkedIn. Target 150 responses. Content plan: "State of AI Video 2025" blog post + infographic.

**Example 2:** "Create a benchmark for affiliate marketing earnings"
→ Aggregate public data from case studies, combine with original survey. Monthly recurring data collection. "Affiliate Marketing Earnings Benchmark Q1 2025."

**Example 3:** "Data moat for my content strategy" (after content-moat-calculator)
→ Identify that competitors have generic content but NO original data. Design case study collection: "How 50 Affiliate Marketers Made Their First $1,000." Instant authority.

## Revenue & Action Plan

### Expected Outcomes
- **Revenue potential**: Original data content earns 5-10x more backlinks than generic content. Backlinks → higher domain authority → higher rankings for ALL your affiliate pages. One original data post can increase total site traffic by 20-50% over 6 months
- **Benchmark**: Data-driven blog posts get 2x more shares and 3x more backlinks than opinion posts. "State of [Industry]" posts are the most linked-to content format in B2B niches
- **Key metric to track**: Backlinks earned by the data content (check via Ahrefs, Semrush, or Google Search Console). Secondary: organic traffic increase to ALL affiliate pages (rising tide lifts all boats)

### Do This Right Now (15 min)
1. **Launch the survey or start data collection TODAY** — don't wait for the "perfect" survey. 80% good is enough to start
2. **Post the survey link** in 3 places immediately: your email list, one relevant subreddit, and one social platform
3. **Set a 2-week deadline** for data collection — urgency drives responses
4. **Pre-write the blog post outline** using the Content Plan section — so you're ready to publish the moment data comes in

### Track Your Results
After data collection: publish the findings as a blog post with `affiliate-blog-builder`. After 30 days: how many backlinks did the data post earn? After 90 days: did organic traffic to your money pages increase? If yes, plan your next data collection round — proprietary data compounds.

> **Next step — copy-paste this prompt:**
> "Write a blog post presenting my original research findings about [topic]" → runs `affiliate-blog-builder`

## Flywheel Connections

### Feeds Into
- `affiliate-blog-builder` (S3) — unique data angles for articles nobody else can write
- `content-pillar-atomizer` (S2) — data findings to atomize across platforms

## 46. Expert Skill: paid-ad-copy-writer
> **Path within category:** `skills/automation/paid-ad-copy-writer/SKILL.md`


# Paid Ad Copy Writer

Write paid ad copy for affiliate offers — Facebook Ads, Google Search Ads, Google Display Ads, TikTok Ads, and Pinterest Ads. Each output includes multiple ad variants, targeting suggestions, compliance notes, and campaign setup guidance. Output is platform-formatted ad copy ready to deploy.

## Stage

S7: Automation — When organic content proves profitable, paid ads let you scale 10x faster. But affiliate ad copy has unique constraints: platform policies around affiliate links, FTC disclosure requirements, and the need to drive clicks to a landing page (not direct-link). This skill writes compliant, high-converting ad copy for each platform.

## When to Use

- User wants to run paid traffic to affiliate offers
- User says "write ad copy", "Facebook ad", "Google Ads", "TikTok ad"
- User wants to scale a profitable organic campaign with paid media
- User has a landing page (from S4) and wants ads driving traffic to it
- User wants multiple ad variants for testing
- Chaining from S4 (landing page) → write ads pointing to the landing page

## Input Schema

```yaml
product:
  name: string                 # REQUIRED — product name
  description: string          # OPTIONAL — one-line product description
  reward_value: string         # OPTIONAL — commission info
  url: string                  # OPTIONAL — product URL (for research)
  key_benefits: string[]       # OPTIONAL — top 3 benefits

platform: string               # REQUIRED — "facebook" | "google_search" | "google_display"
                               # | "tiktok" | "pinterest"

audience:
  description: string          # REQUIRED — target audience
  pain_points: string[]        # OPTIONAL — problems the audience has
  demographics: string         # OPTIONAL — age, gender, interests

budget: string                 # OPTIONAL — daily/monthly budget (e.g., "$20/day")

landing_url: string            # OPTIONAL — destination URL (from S4 or a bridge page)
                               # Note: most platforms don't allow direct affiliate links
```

**Chaining context**: If S1 product data exists, pull name, benefits, commission. If S4 landing page was created, use its URL as `landing_url`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Product and Audience

Gather product info and audience details. If `key_benefits` is not provided, infer from product name and description using training knowledge.

Identify:
- Primary value proposition
- Emotional triggers for the audience
- Competitive angle (what makes this product different)

### Step 2: Select Ad Format

Each platform has specific formats:

**Facebook Ads**:
- Primary text (125 chars above fold, 500+ total)
- Headline (40 chars)
- Description (30 chars)
- CTA button (from predefined list)

**Google Search Ads**:
- Headlines (3 × 30 chars)
- Descriptions (2 × 90 chars)
- Sitelink extensions (4 × 25 chars + 35 char descriptions)

**Google Display Ads**:
- Short headline (30 chars)
- Long headline (90 chars)
- Description (90 chars)
- Business name

**TikTok Ads**:
- Video script (15-30 seconds)
- Hook (first 3 seconds)
- CTA overlay text
- Ad text (100 chars)

**Pinterest Ads**:
- Pin title (100 chars)
- Pin description (500 chars)
- Image text suggestions

### Step 3: Write Ad Variants

Create 3-5 variants per platform, each testing a different angle:
- **Pain Point**: Lead with the problem
- **Benefit**: Lead with the outcome
- **Social Proof**: Lead with results/numbers
- **Curiosity**: Lead with an intriguing question or statement
- **Urgency**: Lead with a time-sensitive offer (only if real)

### Step 4: Add Compliance Notes

Per platform:
- **Facebook**: "Paid Partnership" label if required. No misleading claims. Landing page must match ad claims. Affiliate links may be flagged — use a bridge/landing page.
- **Google**: Ad must match landing page content. No superlative claims without proof. Affiliate disclaimer on landing page required. Follow Google Ads affiliate policies.
- **TikTok**: #ad or Paid Partnership toggle. No medical/financial advice. Must feel native to platform.
- **Pinterest**: Disclosures in pin description. Must link to content page, not direct affiliate link.

### Step 5: Suggest Targeting

Recommend targeting parameters:
- Interest-based audiences
- Lookalike audiences (if pixel data exists)
- Keyword targeting (Google)
- Demographic filters

### Step 6: Budget Allocation

If budget is provided, suggest:
- Daily spend per variant (for A/B testing phase)
- When to kill underperformers (after 500+ impressions with <0.5% CTR)
- When to scale winners (after 3+ days of profitable ROAS)

### Step 7: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] 3-5 ad variants generated per platform
- [ ] Character counts within platform limits (Google: 30/90 headline/description, Facebook: 40/125/27000)
- [ ] No prohibited claims (income guarantees, before/after without evidence)
- [ ] CTA uses platform-native action verbs
- [ ] Test budget recommendation is realistic ($5-20/day per variant)

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
campaign:
  product: string
  platform: string
  num_variants: number
  landing_url: string

variants:
  - label: string              # "Variant A: Pain Point", etc.
    angle: string              # the approach used
    copy:
      headline: string         # or headlines[] for Google
      description: string      # or descriptions[] for Google
      primary_text: string     # Facebook only
      cta: string
      video_script: string     # TikTok only
    character_counts: object   # per field

compliance:
  notes: string[]              # platform-specific requirements
  warnings: string[]           # things that might get the ad rejected

targeting:
  interests: string[]
  demographics: string
  keywords: string[]           # Google only

budget_suggestion:
  test_phase: string           # e.g., "$10/day per variant for 5 days"
  scale_phase: string          # e.g., "Increase winning variant to $50/day"
  kill_criteria: string        # when to stop a variant
```

## Output Format

1. **Campaign Overview** — product, platform, landing URL
2. **Ad Variants** — each variant with full copy in platform format
3. **Compliance Checklist** — platform-specific requirements and warnings
4. **Targeting Suggestions** — interests, demographics, keywords
5. **Budget Guide** — test and scale strategy

## Error Handling

- **No landing URL**: "Most ad platforms don't allow direct affiliate links. I recommend creating a landing page first with S4 (landing-page-creator) and using that as your ad destination."
- **Unknown platform**: "I support Facebook, Google Search, Google Display, TikTok, and Pinterest ads. Which platform would you like ad copy for?"
- **Product with strict ad policies (supplements, finance)**: "This product category has strict advertising policies on [platform]. I'll write compliant copy, but review your ad account's specific restrictions before publishing. Avoid health/income claims."

## Examples

### Example 1: Facebook ad for SaaS product

**User**: "Write Facebook ads for HeyGen targeting content creators. My landing page is example.com/heygen-review"
**Action**: 3 variants. Variant A (pain point): "Spending hours editing videos? HeyGen creates professional AI videos in minutes." Variant B (benefit): "Create studio-quality videos without a camera. 50+ AI avatars, any language." Variant C (social proof): "10,000+ creators switched to HeyGen. Here's why." Each with headline, description, CTA. Include Facebook compliance notes.

### Example 2: Google Search ads

**User**: "Google Search ads for Semrush targeting 'best SEO tools'"
**Action**: 5 headline + 2 description combinations. H1: "Best SEO Tool for 2026" (30 chars). H2: "Try Semrush Free Today" (22 chars). H3: "Trusted by 10M+ Marketers" (25 chars). D1: "Complete SEO toolkit: keyword research, site audit, backlink analysis. Start your free trial." D2: "Outrank your competitors with data-driven SEO. 7-day free trial, no card required." Plus sitelink extensions.

### Example 3: TikTok ad script

**User**: "Write a TikTok ad for Notion targeting college students"
**Action**: 30-second script. Hook (0-3s): "POV: You just discovered the app that replaced 5 other apps." Middle (3-20s): Show use cases (notes, calendar, to-do, project tracker). CTA (20-30s): "Link in bio for the student discount." #ad disclosure. Include compliance notes about TikTok's policies on educational content promotions.

## Revenue & Action Plan

### Expected Outcomes
- **Revenue potential**: Paid ads are the fastest way to scale a profitable affiliate funnel. If your organic funnel converts at $2 EPC, and your CPC is $0.50, you're making $1.50 profit per click. At 100 clicks/day = $150/day = $4,500/month profit
- **Benchmark**: Profitable affiliate ad campaigns typically achieve 2-4x ROAS (Return On Ad Spend). Below 1.5x ROAS = unprofitable. Above 3x ROAS = scale aggressively
- **Key metric to track**: ROAS (revenue from commissions / ad spend). Secondary: CPC (cost per click), CTR (click-through rate), and conversion rate on landing page

### Do This Right Now (15 min)
1. **Launch a test campaign** with your top 2 ad variants at $10/day each
2. **Set the destination URL** to your landing page (from `landing-page-creator`), NOT a direct affiliate link
3. **Set a kill rule**: if a variant has 500+ impressions and <0.5% CTR after 48 hours, pause it
4. **Set a scale rule**: if a variant achieves 2x+ ROAS after 5 days, increase budget by 50%

### Track Your Results
After 48 hours: kill any variant with <0.5% CTR. After 5 days: is any variant profitable (ROAS > 1.5x)? If yes, scale it by increasing daily budget. If no variant is profitable, test new angles — the ad copy may not match the audience's pain point. Never scale a losing campaign.

# Multi-Program Manager

Manage and compare multiple affiliate programs as a portfolio — overview, performance comparison, diversification strategy, program switching decisions, and revenue allocation. Output is a portfolio dashboard with strategic recommendations and a weekly action plan.

## Stage

S7: Automation — Most affiliates either promote too few programs (concentration risk) or too many (effort dilution). This skill applies portfolio thinking to affiliate marketing: analyze your programs like investments, identify which to double down on, maintain, or drop, and allocate your limited time for maximum ROI.

## When to Use

- User manages multiple affiliate programs and wants a strategic overview
- User asks "which program should I focus on?" or "should I drop this program?"
- User wants to diversify their affiliate income
- User says "compare my programs", "portfolio review", "program strategy"
- User is deciding whether to add or remove programs
- Chaining from S6.3 (performance-report): take performance data and make strategic decisions

## Input Schema

```yaml
programs:
  - name: string               # REQUIRED — program name
    affiliate_url: string      # OPTIONAL — affiliate link
    reward_value: string       # OPTIONAL — commission (e.g., "30% recurring")
    reward_type: string        # OPTIONAL — "cps_recurring" | "cps_one_time" | "cpl" | "cpc"
    monthly_revenue: number    # OPTIONAL — avg monthly revenue ($)
    monthly_clicks: number     # OPTIONAL — avg monthly clicks
    niche: string              # OPTIONAL — product category
    status: string             # OPTIONAL — "active" | "paused" | "new" | "considering"

goal: string                   # OPTIONAL — "maximize_revenue" | "diversify"
                               # | "reduce_risk" | "find_gaps"
                               # Default: "maximize_revenue"

budget_hours: number           # OPTIONAL — weekly hours available for content
                               # Default: 10
```

**Chaining context**: If S1 program research or S6.3 performance data exists in conversation, pull program details and metrics automatically.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Build Portfolio Overview

Compile all programs into a dashboard:
- Program name, niche, commission type, commission value
- Monthly revenue, clicks, EPC
- Status (active/paused/new)
- Revenue share (% of total)

### Step 2: Calculate Per-Program Metrics

For each program with data:
- **EPC**: revenue / clicks
- **Revenue Share**: program revenue / total revenue × 100
- **Effort-to-Revenue Ratio**: estimated hours spent / revenue generated
- **Commission Quality Score**: recurring > one-time > per-lead > per-click

### Step 3: Apply Portfolio Analysis

**Concentration Risk**:
- If top program > 50% of revenue → HIGH RISK
- If top 2 programs > 80% → MODERATE RISK
- If no program > 30% → WELL DIVERSIFIED

**Niche Overlap**:
- Multiple programs in same niche → competing for same audience
- Different niches → healthy diversification

**Revenue Stability**:
- Recurring commissions → stable
- One-time commissions → volatile (need constant new traffic)

### Step 4: Generate Recommendations

For each program, assign an action:
- **Double Down**: High EPC, room to grow → create more content, scale traffic
- **Maintain**: Solid performer, no changes needed → keep existing content fresh
- **Optimize**: High traffic but low conversion → improve CTAs, landing pages, test variants
- **Phase Out**: Low EPC, low growth potential → redirect effort to better programs
- **Add**: Gap identified → research new programs with S1

### Step 5: Create Action Plan

Based on `budget_hours`, allocate weekly time:
- Double-down programs get 50% of time
- Maintain programs get 20%
- Optimize programs get 20%
- New program research gets 10%

Provide specific weekly tasks tied to Affitor skills.

### Step 6: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] Revenue share percentages sum to ~100%
- [ ] EPC calculations correct (revenue ÷ clicks per program)
- [ ] Concentration risk accurate (flag if top program >50% of revenue)
- [ ] Actions match performance: double_down (Star), maintain (Cash Cow), optimize (Question Mark), phase_out (Dog)
- [ ] Weekly time allocation sums to user's stated hours budget

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
portfolio:
  total_programs: number
  active_programs: number
  total_monthly_revenue: number
  concentration_risk: string   # "high" | "moderate" | "low"
  niche_diversification: string # "good" | "overlapping" | "single_niche"
  revenue_stability: string    # "stable" | "moderate" | "volatile"

programs:
  - name: string
    niche: string
    reward_type: string
    monthly_revenue: number
    epc: number
    revenue_share: number
    action: string             # "double_down" | "maintain" | "optimize" | "phase_out"
    reason: string

recommendations:
  - action: string
    program: string
    skill: string              # which Affitor skill to use
    task: string               # specific task
    priority: number           # 1 = highest

weekly_plan:
  total_hours: number
  allocation:
    - program: string
      hours: number
      tasks: string[]
```

## Output Format

1. **Portfolio Dashboard** — table with all programs, revenue, EPC, revenue share
2. **Portfolio Health** — concentration risk, diversification, stability assessment
3. **Program Scorecards** — per-program action (double down / maintain / optimize / phase out) with reason
4. **Strategic Recommendations** — prioritized list of actions with Affitor skill references
5. **Weekly Action Plan** — hour-by-hour allocation with specific tasks

## Error Handling

- **Only one program**: "You have a single program. That's 100% concentration risk. I'll analyze it and recommend 2-3 complementary programs using S1 (affiliate-program-search)."
- **No revenue data**: "Without revenue data, I'll analyze based on commission structure and niche overlap. For deeper analysis, run S6.3 (performance-report) first to get your numbers."
- **All programs in same niche**: "All your programs are in [niche]. You're diversified by product but not by market. If [niche] declines, all your income is at risk. Consider adding programs in adjacent niches."

## Examples

### Example 1: Portfolio with clear winner

**User**: "I promote HeyGen ($450/mo), Semrush ($320/mo), Notion ($125/mo), Canva ($80/mo). Which should I focus on?"
**Action**: HeyGen is the star (46% revenue, likely highest EPC). Recommend: Double down on HeyGen (more blog content, S7 content-repurposer). Maintain Semrush. Optimize Notion (high conversion rate potential). Evaluate Canva (low revenue, is it worth the effort?). Weekly plan: 5h HeyGen, 2h Semrush, 2h Notion, 1h research.

### Example 2: Diversification analysis

**User**: "I make $2K/month from 3 SaaS tools. How do I reduce risk?"
**Action**: All income from one niche (SaaS) = moderate risk. Recommend: Add 1-2 programs in adjacent niches (e.g., online courses, hosting). Check commission types — if all one-time, recommend adding recurring programs. Use S1 to research programs in new niches.

### Example 3: Program switching decision

**User**: "Should I drop Canva ($80/mo, 500 clicks) and replace it with Jasper?"
**Action**: Canva EPC = $0.16 (low). Calculate opportunity cost: 500 clicks redirected to a $0.50+ EPC program = $250/mo potential. Research Jasper commission (likely $100+ per sale). Recommend: Yes, switch. Use S1 to evaluate Jasper, then S3 for a comparison blog post.

## 48. Expert Skill: content-repurposer
> **Path within category:** `skills/automation/content-repurposer/SKILL.md`


# Content Repurposer

Repurpose one piece of affiliate content into multiple formats — blog post to tweets, landing page to email, video script to blog, social post to newsletter. Each output is adapted to the target platform's rules, tone, length, and FTC requirements. Output is a set of ready-to-post content blocks.

## Stage

S7: Automation — Creating content from scratch is expensive. The fastest way to scale is to repurpose what already works. One blog post can become 5 tweets, 1 LinkedIn post, 1 Reddit post, and 2 emails — multiplying your reach without multiplying your effort.

## When to Use

- User has existing content and wants it on more platforms
- User says "turn my blog into tweets" or "repurpose this for LinkedIn"
- User wants to scale content distribution without writing from scratch
- User says "cross-post", "content recycling", "omnichannel"
- User has a winning piece and wants to maximize its ROI
- Chaining from S2-S5: take any content output and adapt it for additional platforms

## Input Schema

```yaml
source_content: string         # REQUIRED — the original content (full text, or from conversation)

source_type: string            # REQUIRED — "blog" | "social" | "landing" | "email"
                               # | "video_script" | "newsletter"

target_formats:                # REQUIRED — formats to repurpose into
  - string                     # "tweet_thread" | "linkedin_post" | "tiktok_script"
                               # | "newsletter" | "reddit_post" | "email"
                               # | "blog_summary" | "pinterest_pin"

product:
  name: string                 # OPTIONAL — product being promoted
  affiliate_url: string        # OPTIONAL — affiliate link to include in each format
```

**Chaining context**: If S2-S5 content was generated in the same conversation, reference it directly: "repurpose my blog post for Twitter and LinkedIn."

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Source Content

Extract from the source:
- **Core value proposition**: The main benefit or insight
- **Key hooks**: Attention-grabbing statements or data points
- **Proof points**: Statistics, testimonials, personal experience
- **CTA**: The action the reader should take
- **Affiliate link**: The link to preserve in all formats

### Step 2: Map to Target Formats

For each target format, define constraints:
- **Tweet thread**: 5-10 tweets, 280 chars each, hook in tweet 1, CTA + link in last tweet
- **LinkedIn post**: 1,300 chars max for full visibility, professional tone, no link in body (comments)
- **TikTok script**: 30-60 seconds, spoken word, hook in first 3 seconds, CTA at end
- **Newsletter**: 500-800 words, subject line + preview, value-first structure
- **Reddit post**: Authentic tone, value-first, disclosure at bottom, suggest subreddit
- **Email**: Subject + preview + body + CTA, 200-300 words
- **Blog summary**: 300-500 words condensed version with key points
- **Pinterest pin**: Title (40 chars), description (500 chars), image text suggestion

### Step 3: Adapt Content

For each target format:
1. Select the most relevant hooks and proof points
2. Rewrite in the platform's native voice and format
3. Adjust length to platform norms
4. Place affiliate link according to platform best practices
5. Add platform-appropriate FTC disclosure

### Step 4: Add Platform-Specific Posting Guides

For each output, include:
- Best time to post (general guidance)
- Hashtag strategy (if applicable)
- Engagement tips specific to the platform
- Link placement rules

### Step 5: Output All Variants

Present each format as a separate, clearly labeled block ready to copy and paste.

### Step 6: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] Each format is adapted to its platform (not copy-pasted across formats)
- [ ] Character counts are within platform limits
- [ ] FTC disclosure present in every variant that contains affiliate link
- [ ] Core value proposition preserved across all repurposed formats
- [ ] Affiliate link placement follows platform-specific rules

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
repurposed:
  source_type: string
  source_summary: string       # one-sentence summary of original
  formats_generated: number

outputs:
  - format: string             # target format name
    content: string            # the repurposed content (ready to post)
    platform: string           # which platform this is for
    character_count: number
    affiliate_link_placement: string  # where the link goes
    disclosure: string         # FTC disclosure used
    posting_guide:
      best_time: string
      hashtags: string[]
      tips: string[]
```

## Output Format

1. **Source Summary** — one paragraph describing the original content
2. **Repurposed Content** — each format as a separate block with clear headers
3. **Posting Guide** — per-format tips for best results
4. **Affiliate Link Summary** — which formats include the link and where

## Error Handling

- **Source content too short (<100 words)**: "The source content is quite short. I'll work with what's here, but longer source content produces better repurposed variants. Consider using the full blog post rather than just the intro."
- **No affiliate link**: "I'll repurpose the content without an affiliate link. Add `[YOUR_AFFILIATE_LINK]` where I've marked the CTA before posting."
- **Incompatible format**: "Converting a tweet to a blog post is more like 'expanding' than 'repurposing.' Use S3 (affiliate-blog-builder) to write a full blog post around this topic instead."

## Examples

### Example 1: Blog to social media

**User**: "Turn my HeyGen review blog post into a tweet thread and LinkedIn post"
**Action**: Extract key points from the blog (top 5 features, pricing, verdict). Tweet thread: Hook tweet → 5 feature tweets with mini-takes → verdict tweet → CTA tweet with link + #ad. LinkedIn post: Professional angle (time savings, ROI), personal experience tone, link in first comment, #ad disclosure.

### Example 2: Landing page to email

**User**: "Repurpose my Semrush landing page into a 3-email sequence"
**Action**: Extract value proposition, benefits, social proof, CTA from landing page. Email 1: Problem awareness (pain point from landing page). Email 2: Solution introduction (benefits). Email 3: CTA (affiliate link + urgency from landing page). Each email under 300 words.

### Example 3: Social post to newsletter

**User**: "My LinkedIn post about AI tools got 500 likes. Turn it into a newsletter."
**Action**: Expand the LinkedIn post's hook into a newsletter intro. Add depth: examples, data, personal experience that couldn't fit in 1,300 chars. Structure: Hook → context → 3 insights → recommendation → CTA. Include FTC disclosure and affiliate link.

## Revenue & Action Plan

### Expected Outcomes
- **Revenue potential**: Repurposing multiplies the revenue of a single piece of content across platforms. One winning blog post repurposed to 5 platforms = 5x more affiliate link exposure. If the original blog earns $200/month, repurposed versions can add $100-500/month from new traffic sources
- **Benchmark**: The best-performing repurposed format is usually email (highest CTR, 2-5%) and LinkedIn (highest professional engagement). Reddit drives the highest conversion rate (3-5%) but lowest volume
- **Key metric to track**: Affiliate link clicks per repurposed format. Which platform sends the most clicks per piece of content?

### Do This Right Now (15 min)
1. **Post the highest-potential repurposed piece immediately** — usually the LinkedIn or X version (fastest engagement)
2. **Schedule the rest** across the next 5-7 days — one platform per day to maximize algorithm reach
3. **Add UTM parameters** to every affiliate link: `?utm_source=[platform]&utm_medium=repurpose&utm_campaign=[original_title]`
4. **Bookmark the original** — if any repurposed version goes viral, create more content on that angle

### Track Your Results
After 14 days: which repurposed format drove the most affiliate clicks? Focus your repurposing effort on that format first in the future. Kill formats that consistently get zero clicks — not every platform works for every niche.

# Email Automation Builder

Build multi-sequence email automation flows with branching logic, segmentation, triggers, and tool-specific setup. More advanced than S5 email-drip-sequence: this skill creates conditional flows that respond to subscriber behavior (opened, clicked, purchased). Output includes ASCII flow diagrams, email content, and platform setup instructions.

## Stage

S7: Automation — S5's email-drip-sequence is a linear 7-email series. Real email marketing uses branching flows: if they opened → send X, if they didn't → send Y, if they clicked the affiliate link → move to a different sequence. This skill builds the automation system, not just the emails.

## When to Use

- User needs email flows with conditional logic (if/then branches)
- User wants welcome series, nurture flows, win-back campaigns, or cart abandonment
- User says "email automation", "branching email", "conditional sequence"
- User wants to set up flows in ConvertKit, Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, or Beehiiv
- User already has an S5 drip sequence and wants to upgrade it to a full automation
- Chaining: upgrade S5 `email-drip-sequence` output to a branching automation

## Input Schema

```yaml
product:
  name: string                 # REQUIRED — product being promoted
  affiliate_url: string        # REQUIRED — affiliate link
  reward_value: string         # OPTIONAL — commission info (e.g., "30% recurring")

audience:
  description: string          # REQUIRED — who the subscribers are
  segments:                    # OPTIONAL — audience segments for branching
    - string                   # e.g., ["cold_leads", "warm_leads", "buyers"]

flow_type: string              # OPTIONAL — "welcome" | "nurture" | "winback"
                               # | "reengagement" | "cart_abandon"
                               # Default: "welcome"

email_tool: string             # OPTIONAL — "convertkit" | "mailchimp"
                               # | "activecampaign" | "beehiiv"
                               # Default: generic (works with any ESP)

num_emails: number             # OPTIONAL — total emails in the flow (5-12)
                               # Default: 7

lead_magnet: string            # OPTIONAL — what they opted in for
```

**Chaining context**: If S5 email-drip-sequence was run earlier, offer to upgrade it: "I see you have a 7-email drip sequence. Want me to upgrade it with branching logic and segments?"

## Workflow

### Step 1: Map Flow Type to Template

Select automation template based on `flow_type`:

**Welcome Flow**: Trigger → Welcome email → Wait 1 day → Value email → Branch (opened? → Soft sell / didn't open? → Re-engagement) → Continue selling to openers, re-engage non-openers

**Nurture Flow**: Trigger → Educational series → Branch (clicked affiliate link? → Move to sales sequence / didn't click? → Continue nurturing) → Post-purchase thank you for converters

**Win-back Flow**: Trigger (inactive 30+ days) → "We miss you" → Wait 3 days → Value reminder → Branch (re-engaged? → Move to nurture / still inactive? → Last chance) → Sunset after no response

### Step 2: Define Triggers and Entry Conditions

For each flow, specify:
- **Entry trigger**: What starts the flow (new subscriber, tag added, purchase, inactivity)
- **Exit conditions**: What removes someone (purchase, unsubscribe, entered different flow)
- **Branch conditions**: Opens, clicks, purchases, time-based

### Step 3: Design Branching Logic

Create decision points:
- After email N: Did they open? (Branch A: opened, Branch B: not opened)
- After email N: Did they click affiliate link? (Branch A: clicked, Branch B: didn't)
- After email N: Did they purchase? (Branch A: buyer → thank you, Branch B: non-buyer → continue)

### Step 4: Write Each Email

For each email in each branch, write:
- Subject line (40-60 chars)
- Preview text (80-100 chars)
- Body copy (200-400 words)
- CTA (single, clear)
- FTC disclosure (for emails with affiliate links)

### Step 5: Add Wait Times

Between emails:
- Welcome flow: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 days
- Nurture flow: 2, 4, 7, 10, 14 days
- Win-back flow: 0, 3, 7, 14 days
- Adjust based on audience engagement patterns

### Step 6: Output Flow + Setup

Present:
- ASCII flow diagram showing the full automation
- Each email's content
- Tool-specific setup instructions (if email_tool specified)

### Step 7: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] Every branch path leads to a valid next step (no dead ends)
- [ ] All emails are complete in each branch (subject, body, CTA)
- [ ] Wait times between emails sum correctly to total flow duration
- [ ] FTC disclosure present on all emails containing affiliate links
- [ ] Branch conditions are clear boolean logic (opened/clicked/didn't)

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
automation:
  flow_type: string
  product: string
  total_emails: number
  total_branches: number

    type: string               # "email" | "wait" | "branch" | "exit"
    email:                     # present if type is "email"
      subject: string
      preview: string
      body: string
      cta: string
      has_affiliate_link: boolean

    branch:                    # present if type is "branch"
      condition: string        # e.g., "opened previous email?"
      yes_path: number         # step number for yes
      no_path: number          # step number for no

setup:
  tool: string
  steps: string[]              # tool-specific setup instructions
  tags: string[]               # recommended tags to apply
  segments: string[]           # recommended segments
```

## Output Format

1. **Flow Overview** — flow type, total emails, total days, branch count
2. **ASCII Flow Diagram** — visual representation of the automation with branches
3. **Email Content** — each email with subject, preview, body, CTA (grouped by branch)
4. **Setup Instructions** — tool-specific steps to build this automation
5. **Tags & Segments** — recommended tagging strategy for tracking

## Error Handling

- **No product info**: "What affiliate product are you promoting? I need the product name and your affiliate link to write the email content."
- **Unknown email tool**: "I don't have specific setup instructions for [tool]. I'll provide generic automation logic that works with any ESP — just map the triggers, waits, and branches to your tool's interface."
- **Too many emails requested (>12)**: "12+ emails in one flow is usually too many. I'll create a 7-email flow with branches. For longer nurture, consider chaining two separate flows."
- **Upgrading from S5**: "I see your existing 7-email drip. I'll keep the email content and add branching logic: opened/not-opened splits after emails 2 and 4, and a purchase detection branch after email 5."

## Examples

### Example 1: Welcome flow with branches

**User**: "Build a welcome email automation for HeyGen (affiliate link: heygen.com/ref/abc123) for content creators who downloaded my AI tools guide."
**Action**: 7-email welcome flow. Email 1: Deliver guide. Email 2: Value (AI video tip). Branch: Did they open email 2? Yes → Email 3 (soft sell HeyGen). No → Email 3b (re-engagement with different subject). Continue branching through to email 7. ASCII diagram + all email content + ConvertKit setup.

### Example 2: Upgrade existing S5 drip

**User**: "Take my email drip sequence from earlier and add automation logic."
**Action**: Keep the 7 emails from S5 output. Add branches: After email 2 (opened → continue / not opened → resend with new subject). After email 4 (clicked affiliate link → skip to email 5 hard sell / didn't click → add extra value email). After email 5 (purchased → exit + thank you / didn't purchase → continue to email 6-7).

### Example 3: Win-back flow

**User**: "Create a win-back sequence for subscribers who haven't opened emails in 30 days. I promote Semrush."
**Action**: 4-email win-back flow. Trigger: 30 days no opens. Email 1: "Still interested in SEO?" (curiosity). Wait 3 days. Email 2: Value piece (SEO tip). Branch: Opened? Yes → Move to nurture flow. No → Email 3: "Last chance" (urgency). No response after 7 days → Sunset (remove from list).

## Revenue & Action Plan

### Expected Outcomes
- **Revenue potential**: Email automation is the closest thing to passive income in affiliate marketing. A well-built welcome flow converts 5-15% of subscribers to affiliate clicks. With 500 new subscribers/month × 10% click rate × 3% conversion × $50 commission = $750/month on autopilot
- **Benchmark**: Email marketing delivers $42 return per $1 spent. Branching flows outperform linear sequences by 25-40% because they send the right message to the right person at the right time
- **Key metric to track**: Revenue per subscriber per month. Industry benchmark for affiliate email: $0.50-2.00/subscriber/month. Below $0.50 = weak offer or poor segmentation

### Do This Right Now (15 min)
1. **Set up Email 1 (Welcome/Deliver) in your ESP today** — this is the highest-open-rate email (60-80% open rate). Get it live immediately
2. **Create the first branch trigger** — "opened Email 2?" — in your ESP's automation builder
3. **Schedule remaining emails** in the flow — most ESPs let you build the full automation in one session
4. **Test the flow** — subscribe with a test email address and verify every branch works

### Track Your Results
After 30 days: what's the open rate on each email? Click rate on affiliate links? Revenue attributed to the flow? If Email 3+ have <15% open rate, test new subject lines. If affiliate CTR is <2%, strengthen the CTA or add bonuses.

# SEO Audit

Audit affiliate blog posts and landing pages for SEO issues — on-page optimization, keyword usage, meta tags, content quality signals, affiliate link attributes, and internal linking. Output is a 10-dimension SEO scorecard with a prioritized fix-it checklist.

## Stage

S6: Analytics — 53% of all website traffic comes from organic search. For affiliate bloggers, SEO is the most sustainable traffic source — but most affiliate content has basic SEO mistakes that tank rankings. This skill catches those mistakes and provides quick wins.

## When to Use

- User has a blog post or landing page and wants an SEO review
- User asks "why isn't my page ranking?" or "check my SEO"
- User wants to improve search rankings for affiliate content
- User says "SEO audit", "SEO checklist", "on-page optimization"
- User wants to check affiliate link attributes (nofollow, sponsored)
- Chaining from S3 (blog) or S4 (landing): audit content before or after publishing

## Input Schema

```yaml
content: string                # REQUIRED — the content to audit (markdown, HTML, or URL)
                               # If URL, will attempt to fetch and analyze

target_keyword: string         # REQUIRED — primary keyword to optimize for
                               # (e.g., "best AI video tools", "HeyGen review")

content_type: string           # OPTIONAL — "blog_post" | "landing_page"
                               # Default: "blog_post"

competitor_urls:               # OPTIONAL — competitor pages to compare against
  - string                     # e.g., ["competitor.com/heygen-review"]

secondary_keywords:            # OPTIONAL — additional keywords to check
  - string                     # e.g., ["AI video generator", "HeyGen pricing"]
```

**Chaining context**: If S3 (blog) or S4 (landing page) was run in the same conversation, pull the generated content directly for audit. The user should not have to paste content just generated.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Content Structure

Check:
- **Word count**: Is it competitive? (blog: 1500+ words, landing: varies)
- **Heading structure**: H1 present and unique? H2/H3 hierarchy logical?
- **Paragraph length**: Short paragraphs for readability?
- **Content depth**: Does it cover the topic comprehensively?

### Step 2: Check Keyword Usage

Analyze:
- **Title tag**: Contains target keyword? Under 60 characters?
- **H1**: Contains target keyword?
- **First 100 words**: Keyword appears naturally?
- **Keyword density**: 1-2% optimal (not stuffing, not absent)
- **Keyword in subheadings**: At least one H2 contains keyword or variant?
- **LSI keywords**: Related terms present for topical depth?

### Step 3: Evaluate Meta Tags

Check:
- **Title tag length**: 50-60 characters optimal
- **Meta description**: Present? 150-160 characters? Contains keyword? Compelling?
- **OG tags**: Open Graph tags for social sharing
- **Canonical URL**: Present and correct?

### Step 4: Check E-E-A-T Signals

Evaluate:
- **Experience**: First-person experience with the product?
- **Expertise**: Author credentials or demonstrated knowledge?
- **Authoritativeness**: Citing sources, linking to official pages?
- **Trustworthiness**: Transparent disclosure, balanced (pros AND cons)?

### Step 5: Check Affiliate Link Attributes

Verify:
- All affiliate links have `rel="nofollow sponsored"` (Google requirement)
- Links are not cloaked in a way that violates search guidelines
- FTC disclosure is present and above the fold
- Links open in new tab (`target="_blank"`) for UX

### Step 6: Check Internal Linking

Evaluate:
- Links to related content on the same site?
- Anchor text is descriptive (not "click here")?
- Table of contents for long content?

### Step 7: Score on 10 Dimensions

Rate each 1-10:
1. Keyword optimization
2. Content depth and quality
3. Title tag and meta description
4. Heading structure
5. E-E-A-T signals
6. Affiliate link compliance
7. Internal linking
8. Readability and formatting
9. Mobile friendliness indicators
10. Technical SEO basics

### Step 8: Generate Fix-It Checklist

Prioritize fixes by impact:
- **Quick wins**: Fix in 5 minutes, big impact (meta tags, keyword in H1)
- **Medium effort**: Fix in 30 minutes (add sections, improve depth)
- **Major revision**: Fix in 2+ hours (restructure content, add original research)

### Step 9: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] All 10 SEO dimensions scored (1-10 each)
- [ ] Overall score is weighted sum of dimension scores
- [ ] Issues prioritized: quick_win → medium → major
- [ ] Each fix is specific and actionable (not generic advice)
- [ ] Keyword density recommendation is 1-2% (not higher)

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
audit:
  url_or_title: string
  target_keyword: string
  overall_score: number        # out of 100 (sum of 10 dimensions × 10)
  word_count: number

scores:
  - dimension: string
    score: number              # 1-10
    status: string             # "good" | "needs_work" | "critical"
    notes: string

issues:
  - priority: string           # "quick_win" | "medium" | "major"
    dimension: string
    issue: string
    fix: string                # specific action to take
    impact: string             # "high" | "medium" | "low"

checklist:
  - task: string
    priority: string
    done: boolean              # always false (user checks off)
```

## Output Format

1. **SEO Scorecard** — table with 10 dimensions, scores, and status
2. **Overall Score** — X/100 with assessment (Excellent >80, Good 60-80, Needs Work 40-60, Critical <40)
3. **Quick Wins** — fixes that take <5 minutes and have high impact
4. **Full Fix-It Checklist** — all issues ordered by priority with specific actions
5. **Competitor Comparison** — brief notes if competitor URLs were provided

## Error Handling

- **No content provided**: "Paste the content of your blog post or landing page. I'll audit it for SEO issues and give you a prioritized fix-it list."
- **No target keyword**: "What keyword are you trying to rank for? (e.g., 'HeyGen review', 'best AI video tools'). This helps me check keyword usage and optimization."
- **Content is too short (<300 words)**: "This content is quite short (X words). For competitive keywords, aim for 1,500+ words. I'll audit what's here, but content depth is likely your biggest SEO issue."
- **URL provided but cannot be fetched**: "I couldn't fetch that URL. Paste the page content directly and I'll audit it."

## Examples

### Example 1: Blog post with common issues

**User**: "Audit this blog post for 'best AI video tools': [pastes 2000-word blog post]"
**Action**: Score each dimension. Common findings: keyword not in H1 (fix: add to title), affiliate links missing `rel="nofollow sponsored"` (fix: add attributes), no meta description (fix: write one), thin intro section (fix: expand first paragraph). Overall score: 62/100. Quick wins: meta description, H1 keyword, link attributes.

### Example 2: Landing page audit

**User**: "Check the SEO on my HeyGen landing page" [content from S4 in conversation]
**Action**: Pull landing page content from S4 output. Note: landing pages are typically not SEO-optimized (they're conversion-focused). Score accordingly — different expectations for landing pages vs blog posts. Focus on: title tag, meta description, canonical, affiliate link compliance.

### Example 3: Competitive comparison

**User**: "Audit my Semrush review and compare to these competitor pages: [competitor URLs]"
**Action**: Audit user's content first. Then use `web_search` or `web_browse` to analyze competitor content structure (word count, headings, topics covered). Identify content gaps — topics competitors cover that the user doesn't. Recommend additions to improve competitiveness.

# Performance Report

Generate weekly or monthly affiliate performance reports — earnings, clicks, conversions, EPC, top performers, underperformers, and trend analysis. Output is a Markdown report with KPI dashboard, program rankings, and actionable recommendations.

## Stage

S6: Analytics — Data without analysis is just noise. This skill transforms raw affiliate numbers into insights — which programs are worth your time, which are dragging your portfolio down, and where to focus next. Professional affiliates review performance weekly.

## When to Use

- User wants to review their affiliate earnings for a period
- User asks "how are my programs doing?" or "show me my affiliate report"
- User has click/conversion/revenue data and wants analysis
- User wants to compare performance across multiple programs
- User says "weekly report", "monthly report", "earnings breakdown"
- Chaining from S6.1 (conversion-tracker) — analyze the data those links collected

## Input Schema

```yaml
programs:
  - name: string               # REQUIRED — program name (e.g., "HeyGen")
    clicks: number             # OPTIONAL — total clicks this period
    conversions: number        # OPTIONAL — total conversions
    revenue: number            # OPTIONAL — total commission earned ($)
    commission: number         # OPTIONAL — commission per sale ($)
    spend: number              # OPTIONAL — money spent on ads/promotion ($)

period: string                 # OPTIONAL — "week" | "month" | "quarter"
                               # Default: "month"

goals:
  revenue_target: number       # OPTIONAL — target revenue for the period ($)
  conversion_target: number    # OPTIONAL — target conversions

previous_period:               # OPTIONAL — last period's data for trend analysis
  - name: string
    clicks: number
    conversions: number
    revenue: number

notes: string                  # OPTIONAL — context about the period
                               # (e.g., "launched new blog post week 2")
```

**Chaining context**: If S1 program data or S6.1 tracking data exists in conversation, pull program names and any available metrics.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Collect Program Data

Gather data from user input. If data is incomplete, work with what's available and note gaps:
- "You provided revenue but not clicks — I can calculate revenue per program but not EPC or conversion rate."

### Step 2: Calculate KPIs

For each program:
- **EPC** (Earnings Per Click): revenue / clicks
- **Conversion Rate**: conversions / clicks × 100
- **Revenue Share**: program revenue / total revenue × 100
- **CPA** (Cost Per Acquisition): spend / conversions (if spend provided)
- **ROAS** (Return on Ad Spend): revenue / spend (if spend provided)
- **Commission Per Sale**: revenue / conversions

Portfolio-level:
- **Total Revenue**: sum of all program revenue
- **Blended EPC**: total revenue / total clicks
- **Blended Conversion Rate**: total conversions / total clicks × 100
- **Top Performer**: highest EPC program
- **Underperformer**: lowest EPC program

### Step 3: Rank Programs

Sort programs by ROI efficiency:
1. EPC (primary sort)
2. Total revenue (secondary)
3. Conversion rate (tertiary)

Assign labels:
- **Star**: High EPC + high volume → double down
- **Cash Cow**: Moderate EPC + high volume → maintain
- **Question Mark**: High EPC + low volume → scale up
- **Dog**: Low EPC + low volume → consider dropping

### Step 4: Identify Trends

If `previous_period` data is provided:
- Revenue trend: up/down/flat (with percentage)
- Click trend: up/down/flat
- Conversion trend: up/down/flat
- Per-program trends

### Step 5: Generate Recommendations

Based on data:
- **Double down**: Programs with high EPC that need more traffic
- **Optimize**: Programs with high traffic but low conversion (content issue)
- **Phase out**: Programs with low EPC and low volume
- **Investigate**: Programs with unusual patterns (sudden drops)

### Step 6: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] EPC calculation correct: revenue ÷ clicks
- [ ] Conversion rate percentages are accurate
- [ ] Revenue shares across programs sum to ~100%
- [ ] Labels match metrics: Star (high EPC + growth), Cash Cow (high revenue + stable), Question Mark (low data), Dog (declining)
- [ ] Recommendations are specific and reference concrete next steps

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
report:
  period: string
  total_revenue: number
  total_clicks: number
  total_conversions: number
  blended_epc: number
  blended_conversion_rate: number
  goal_progress: string        # "on_track" | "behind" | "ahead" | "no_goal"

programs:
  - name: string
    clicks: number
    conversions: number
    revenue: number
    epc: number
    conversion_rate: number
    revenue_share: number      # percentage of total
    label: string              # "star" | "cash_cow" | "question_mark" | "dog"
    trend: string              # "up" | "down" | "flat" | "new"

recommendations:
  - program: string
    action: string             # "double_down" | "optimize" | "phase_out" | "investigate"
    reason: string
    next_step: string          # specific action to take
```

## Output Format

1. **KPI Dashboard** — summary table with total revenue, clicks, conversions, blended EPC
2. **Program Rankings** — table sorted by EPC with labels (Star/Cash Cow/Question Mark/Dog)
3. **Trend Analysis** — period-over-period comparison (if previous data provided)
4. **Recommendations** — prioritized list of actions per program
5. **Goal Progress** — progress toward targets (if goals provided)

## Error Handling

- **No data provided**: "I need your affiliate numbers to generate a report. At minimum, provide: program names and revenue. Ideally also clicks and conversions. You can get these from your affiliate dashboard or tracking tool."
- **Only one program**: Generate the report for one program. Note: "With only one program, I can't do comparative analysis. Consider adding more programs to diversify. Use S1 (affiliate-program-search) to find complementary programs."
- **Missing clicks (revenue only)**: "Without click data, I can rank programs by revenue but can't calculate EPC or conversion rate. EPC is the most important affiliate metric — consider setting up tracking with S6.1 (conversion-tracker)."

## Examples

### Example 1: Monthly multi-program report

**User**: "Monthly report: HeyGen — 500 clicks, 15 conversions, $450. Semrush — 1200 clicks, 8 conversions, $320. Notion — 300 clicks, 25 conversions, $125."
**Action**: Calculate KPIs. HeyGen: EPC $0.90, CR 3.0% (Star). Semrush: EPC $0.27, CR 0.7% (Question Mark — high traffic, low conversion). Notion: EPC $0.42, CR 8.3% (Cash Cow — high conversion, low revenue per sale). Recommend: Scale HeyGen traffic, optimize Semrush content (CTAs, landing page), maintain Notion.

### Example 2: Week-over-week comparison

**User**: "This week vs last week: HeyGen clicks went from 100 to 150, but conversions dropped from 5 to 3."
**Action**: Flag conversion rate drop (5% → 2%). Diagnose: more traffic but lower quality? New traffic source? Landing page change? Recommend: Check traffic sources, run S6.4 (seo-audit) on landing page, test CTAs with S6.2 (ab-test-generator).

### Example 3: Revenue-only report

**User**: "My programs last month: HeyGen $450, Semrush $320, Notion $125, Canva $80."
**Action**: Revenue-only analysis. Total $975. Revenue share: HeyGen 46%, Semrush 33%, Notion 13%, Canva 8%. Note concentration risk (79% from 2 programs). Recommend: Set up click tracking (S6.1) for deeper analysis, consider diversifying with S1 research.

# A/B Test Generator

Generate A/B test variants for affiliate content — headlines, CTAs, landing page sections, email subject lines, and social post hooks. Each variant includes a hypothesis explaining why it might outperform the original. Output is a Markdown document with the original, variants, hypotheses, and a test plan.

## Stage

S6: Analytics — Small changes in headlines and CTAs can swing conversion rates by 20-50%. A/B testing is how professional affiliates systematically find what converts best. This skill removes the guesswork by generating theory-driven variants using proven copywriting frameworks.

## When to Use

- User wants to improve conversion rates on existing content
- User has a headline, CTA, or email subject line and wants alternatives
- User says "test my headline", "optimize my CTA", "A/B test ideas"
- User has a landing page section that isn't converting
- User wants to compare different messaging approaches
- Chaining from S2-S5: take any content output and generate test variants

## Input Schema

```yaml
original: string               # REQUIRED — the content to test (headline, CTA, paragraph,
                               # email subject line, or full social post)

content_type: string           # REQUIRED — "headline" | "cta" | "landing_section"
                               # | "email_subject" | "social_hook"

goal: string                   # OPTIONAL — "clicks" | "signups" | "purchases"
                               # Default: "clicks"

num_variants: number           # OPTIONAL — number of variants to generate (2-5)
                               # Default: 3

audience: string               # OPTIONAL — who sees this content
                               # (e.g., "SaaS founders", "content creators")

product: string                # OPTIONAL — product being promoted
```

**Chaining context**: If S2-S5 content exists in conversation, the user can reference it: "test the headline from my blog post" or "generate CTA variants for my landing page."

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Original Content

Break down the original into components:
- **Emotional angle**: What emotion does it trigger? (curiosity, fear, desire, urgency)
- **Specificity**: How specific vs vague?
- **Structure**: Question, statement, command, statistic?
- **Framework**: Which copywriting framework does it follow? (PAS, AIDA, 4U, BAB)

### Step 2: Identify Testable Elements

Determine what to vary:
- Emotional angle (switch from curiosity to urgency)
- Specificity (add numbers, remove vagueness)
- Structure (question vs statement)
- Length (shorter vs longer)
- Power words (swap key words for stronger alternatives)
- Social proof (add or remove)

### Step 3: Generate Variants

Create `num_variants` alternatives, each using a different approach:
- **Variant A**: Different emotional angle
- **Variant B**: Different structure/format
- **Variant C**: Different specificity level
- Additional variants explore social proof, urgency, or contrarian angles

Each variant must:
- Preserve the core message and product reference
- Preserve any FTC disclosure from the original
- Be a realistic alternative (not just a word swap)

### Step 4: Write Hypotheses

For each variant, explain:
- What was changed and why
- Which copywriting principle supports the change
- What behavior change is expected (e.g., "Higher CTR because questions create open loops")

### Step 5: Suggest Test Plan

Recommend:
- Sample size needed (minimum 100 impressions per variant for social, 500 for landing pages)
- Test duration (7-14 days minimum)
- What metric to track (CTR, conversion rate, revenue per visitor)
- When to declare a winner (95% statistical significance or practical significance threshold)

### Step 6: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] 3-5 distinct variants generated (not just word swaps)
- [ ] Each hypothesis grounded in a copywriting principle or framework
- [ ] Sample size calculation is present and realistic
- [ ] Test duration is ≥7 days minimum
- [ ] Winner criteria defined with statistical significance threshold

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
test:
  original: string
  content_type: string
  goal: string

variants:
  - label: string              # "Variant A", "Variant B", etc.
    content: string            # the variant text
    change: string             # what was changed
    framework: string          # copywriting principle used
    hypothesis: string         # why this might win

test_plan:
  sample_size: number          # per variant
  duration: string             # recommended test period
  metric: string               # what to measure
  winner_criteria: string      # when to pick a winner
```

## Output Format

1. **Original** — the current content being tested
2. **Variants** — each variant with its content, change description, and hypothesis
3. **Test Plan** — sample size, duration, metric, winner criteria
4. **Quick Win** — if one variant is clearly stronger based on copywriting principles, call it out

## Error Handling

- **Original too short (1-2 words)**: "I need more context. Paste the full headline, CTA, or email subject line you want to test."
- **Content type unclear**: "Is this a headline, CTA button text, email subject line, or social post hook? Knowing the format helps me generate better variants."
- **Too many variants requested (>5)**: "I'll generate 5 high-quality variants. More than 5 makes testing impractical — you'd need a very large audience to reach statistical significance."

## Examples

### Example 1: Blog headline test

**User**: "Test this headline: 'HeyGen Review: Is It Worth It in 2026?'"
**Action**: Generate 3 variants. Variant A: "I Tested HeyGen for 30 Days — Here's What Happened" (curiosity + personal experience). Variant B: "HeyGen vs Synthesia: Which AI Video Tool Wins?" (comparison + specificity). Variant C: "The AI Video Tool That Cut My Production Time by 80%" (result + specificity). Each with hypothesis.

### Example 2: CTA button test

**User**: "Optimize this CTA: 'Start Free Trial'"
**Action**: Variant A: "Try HeyGen Free — No Card Required" (reduces friction). Variant B: "Create Your First AI Video in 2 Minutes" (outcome-focused). Variant C: "Get Started Free →" (shorter, action-oriented). Test plan: minimum 500 clicks per variant, track conversion rate.

### Example 3: Email subject line test

**User**: "I'm sending an email about Semrush. Test this subject: 'Check out Semrush — it's great for SEO'"
**Action**: Identify weakness (vague, no hook). Variant A: "The SEO tool I use to rank #1 (not kidding)" (social proof + curiosity). Variant B: "Your competitors are using this — are you?" (FOMO). Variant C: "3 Semrush features that doubled my organic traffic" (specificity + result). Each preserves FTC compliance.

# Internal Linking Optimizer

Analyze your site's internal link structure and generate an optimized hub-and-spoke linking plan. Finds orphan pages (no internal links pointing to them), identifies link equity bottlenecks, and creates specific linking instructions to maximize SEO impact.

## Stage

S6: Analytics & Optimization — This is analytics/audit work on existing content. Internal linking is the most underutilized SEO lever — it's 100% in your control and costs nothing.

## When to Use

- User wants to improve their site's SEO through better internal linking
- User asks about "orphan pages", "link structure", "hub and spoke"
- User says "internal linking", "link audit", "link equity"
- After publishing new content — new pages need internal links within 48 hours
- After `keyword-cluster-architect` — cluster structure defines the ideal link architecture
- Monthly maintenance task alongside `content-decay-detector`

## Input Schema

```yaml
site_url: string              # REQUIRED — site to analyze
                              # e.g., "myblog.com"

pages: object[]               # OPTIONAL — known pages with their topics
  - url: string
    title: string
    topic_cluster: string     # Which topical cluster it belongs to
    is_hub: boolean           # Is this a hub page?

hub_pages: string[]           # OPTIONAL — URLs of your hub/pillar pages
                              # Default: auto-detected

new_pages: string[]           # OPTIONAL — recently published pages needing links
                              # Default: none
```

**Chaining from S3 keyword-cluster-architect**: Use `keyword_clusters.hub` and `keyword_clusters.clusters` to define ideal link architecture.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Discover Site Structure

1. `web_search`: `site:[site_url]` — discover indexed pages
2. Map pages to topic clusters (if not provided)
3. Identify current hub pages (pages that link to many others)
4. Note orphan pages (pages with few/no internal links pointing to them)

### Step 2: Analyze Current Link Structure

Read `shared/references/seo-strategy.md` for internal linking rules.

For each page group:
- Count internal links TO this page (inlinks)
- Count internal links FROM this page (outlinks)
- Check link depth from homepage (should be ≤ 3 clicks)
- Identify the anchor text used

### Step 3: Identify Issues

Flag:
1. **Orphan pages** — no or few internal links pointing to them
2. **Hub pages with weak linking** — hub should link to ALL spokes in its cluster
3. **Missing spoke-to-spoke links** — related spokes should link to each other
4. **Broken contextual flow** — pages that should link to each other but don't
5. **Over-linked pages** — too many outlinks dilute link equity
6. **Missing reverse links** — spoke links to hub but hub doesn't link back

### Step 4: Generate Linking Instructions

For each issue, provide specific instructions:

```
Page: [URL]
Action: Add internal link to [target URL]
Anchor text: "[suggested anchor]"
Location: [where in the content to add it]
Priority: [P0/P1/P2]
Reason: [why this link matters]
```

### Step 5: Self-Validation

- [ ] Instructions are specific (exact URLs, anchor text, location)
- [ ] Hub-and-spoke architecture is logical
- [ ] Anchor text is natural and keyword-relevant
- [ ] No recommendations to over-link (max 3-5 internal links per 1000 words)
- [ ] New pages have at least 2-3 internal links pointing to them

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"
internal_links:
  site: string
  pages_analyzed: number
  issues_found: number
  links_to_add: number

  orphan_pages: string[]        # Pages with zero/few inlinks
  hub_pages: string[]           # Identified hub pages

  link_actions:
    - source_url: string        # Page to add the link ON
      target_url: string        # Page to link TO
      anchor_text: string       # Suggested anchor text
      location: string          # Where in the content
      priority: string          # "P0" | "P1" | "P2"
      reason: string

  link_structure:               # Current state summary
    total_pages: number
    avg_inlinks: number
    avg_outlinks: number
    max_depth: number

chain_metadata:
  skill_slug: "internal-linking-optimizer"
  stage: "analytics"
  timestamp: string
  suggested_next:
    - "seo-audit"
    - "content-decay-detector"
    - "affiliate-blog-builder"
```

## Output Format

```
## Internal Link Audit: [Site]

### Structure Overview
- **Pages analyzed:** XX
- **Orphan pages:** XX (need links urgently)
- **Hub pages:** XX
- **Links to add:** XX
- **Average inlinks per page:** X.X

### Orphan Pages (P0 — fix immediately)
These pages have no/few internal links and are invisible to Google:
1. [URL] — [title] — 0 inlinks
2. [URL] — [title] — 1 inlink

### Link Actions

#### P0 — Critical
| Source Page | → | Target Page | Anchor Text | Location |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [source] | → | [target] | "[anchor]" | After paragraph about [topic] |

#### P1 — High
[same table]

#### P2 — Maintenance
[same table]

### Hub-and-Spoke Health
| Hub Page | Expected Spokes | Linked Spokes | Missing Links |
|---|---|---|---|
| [hub] | XX | XX | [list missing] |

### Quick Wins
1. [Easiest high-impact link to add]
2. [Second easiest]
3. [Third]
```

## Error Handling

- **No site URL**: "I need your site URL to analyze internal links."
- **Site not indexed**: "This site doesn't appear to be indexed. Check robots.txt and sitemap."
- **Too few pages**: "With only [X] pages, focus on creating more content first. Internal linking becomes powerful at 10+ pages."
- **No hub pages identifiable**: "I can't identify clear hub pages. Run `keyword-cluster-architect` first to define your topic structure."

## Examples

**Example 1:** "Audit my blog's internal links"
→ Discover pages, map structure, find orphan pages, generate specific linking instructions with anchor text and placement.

**Example 2:** "I just published a new article, what should I link to it?"
→ Identify 3-5 existing pages that should link to the new article, with specific anchor text and paragraph locations.

**Example 3:** "Optimize internal links based on my keyword clusters" (after keyword-cluster-architect)
→ Use cluster structure to define ideal hub-spoke links. Compare current vs ideal. Generate gap-filling instructions.

## Revenue & Action Plan

### Expected Outcomes
- **Revenue potential**: Internal linking directly increases organic traffic to your money pages (pages with affiliate links). Fixing orphan pages typically increases their organic traffic by 30-100% within 4-6 weeks. If an orphan page earns $100/month, proper linking can push it to $130-200/month
- **Benchmark**: Sites with optimized internal linking rank 20-40% higher for target keywords. Every hub-spoke connection you add is a signal to Google that your content is authoritative
- **Key metric to track**: Organic traffic to money pages (pages containing affiliate links) — measure before and after internal link optimization. Target: 30%+ traffic increase within 6 weeks

### Do This Right Now (15 min)
1. **Fix the top 3 P0 (Critical) links first** — these are orphan money pages getting zero internal link juice
2. Open each source page, find the suggested paragraph, and add the internal link with the recommended anchor text
3. Submit the updated pages to Google Search Console for re-indexing: `Inspect URL → Request Indexing`
4. Set a monthly reminder to re-run this audit

### Track Your Results
After 4 weeks: check Google Search Console for the orphan pages. Did impressions/clicks increase? After 8 weeks: did rankings improve for target keywords? Internal linking compounds — each optimization makes the next one more powerful.

> **Next step — copy-paste this prompt:**
> "Run an SEO audit on my site to find more optimization opportunities" → runs `seo-audit`

# Conversion Tracker

Set up affiliate conversion tracking — generate UTM-tagged links, create link naming conventions, configure tracking pixel setup instructions, and build a tracking spreadsheet. Output is a Markdown tracking guide with a table of tagged links ready to deploy.

## Stage

S6: Analytics — The difference between amateur and professional affiliates. You can't optimize what you don't measure. After deploying content (S5), you need UTM-tagged links for every platform and content piece to know exactly which channel drives conversions.

## When to Use

- User is about to launch a campaign and needs tracking links
- User wants UTM-tagged links for different platforms
- User says "set up tracking", "create UTM links", "organize my affiliate links"
- User wants to track which content drives the most clicks and conversions
- User is preparing to run ads and needs consistent link tagging
- Chaining from S1 (product selected) → generate tracking links before creating content in S2-S5

## Input Schema

```yaml
product:
  name: string                 # REQUIRED — product name (e.g., "HeyGen")
  affiliate_url: string        # REQUIRED — base affiliate link

platforms:                     # OPTIONAL — where content will be published
  - string                     # e.g., ["linkedin", "twitter", "blog", "email", "reddit"]
                               # Default: ["blog", "twitter", "linkedin"]

campaign_name: string          # OPTIONAL — campaign identifier (e.g., "q1-2026-ai-tools")
                               # Default: auto-generated from product name + date

tracking_tool: string          # OPTIONAL — "google_analytics" | "voluum" | "clickmagick"
                               # | "manual_utm". Default: "manual_utm"

content_types:                 # OPTIONAL — types of content being created
  - string                     # e.g., ["blog_review", "social_post", "email", "landing_page"]
```

**Chaining context**: If S1 was run, pull `recommended_program.affiliate_url` and `recommended_program.name`. If S2-S5 outputs exist, use them to determine platforms and content types automatically.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Product and Platform Info

Collect product name, affiliate URL, and target platforms. If not provided, default to blog + twitter + linkedin (the three most common affiliate channels).

### Step 2: Generate UTM-Tagged Links

For each platform × content-type combination, create a UTM-tagged URL:
- `utm_source`: platform name (e.g., `linkedin`, `twitter`, `blog`)
- `utm_medium`: content type (e.g., `social`, `article`, `email`)
- `utm_campaign`: campaign name (e.g., `heygen-q1-2026`)
- `utm_content`: specific content identifier (e.g., `review-post`, `cta-button`, `bio-link`)

Append UTM parameters to the affiliate URL. Handle URLs that already have query parameters (use `&` not `?`).

### Step 3: Create Link Naming Convention

Establish a consistent naming scheme:
```
{product}-{platform}-{content_type}-{variant}
```
Example: `heygen-linkedin-review-v1`

### Step 4: Build Tracking Setup Guide

Based on `tracking_tool`:
- **Google Analytics**: Event tracking setup, goal configuration, UTM report location
- **Voluum / ClickMagick**: Postback URL setup, conversion pixel placement
- **Manual UTM**: Google Sheets tracking template with columns for link, platform, clicks, conversions

### Step 5: Output Tracking Sheet

Present all links in a structured table with:
- Link name
- Platform
- Content type
- Full tagged URL
- Notes

### Step 6: Self-Validation

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] UTM parameters correctly appended to all affiliate URLs
- [ ] No URL encoding errors in generated links
- [ ] Naming convention is consistent across all links
- [ ] All links are under URL length limits
- [ ] Setup guide steps match the recommended tracking tool

If any check fails, fix the output before delivering. Do not flag the checklist to the user — just ensure the output passes.

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema_version: "1.0.0"  # Semver — bump major on breaking changes
tracking:
  product: string
  campaign: string
  total_links: number

links:
  - name: string               # e.g., "heygen-linkedin-review-v1"
    platform: string
    content_type: string
    url: string                # full UTM-tagged URL
    utm_source: string
    utm_medium: string
    utm_campaign: string
    utm_content: string

naming_convention:
  pattern: string              # e.g., "{product}-{platform}-{type}-{variant}"
  examples: string[]

setup_guide:
  tool: string
  steps: string[]
```

## Output Format

1. **Tracking Links Table** — Markdown table with all tagged links
2. **Naming Convention** — pattern + examples for consistency
3. **Setup Guide** — step-by-step instructions for the chosen tracking tool
4. **Next Steps** — what to do with these links (plug into S2-S5 content)

## Error Handling

- **No affiliate URL provided**: "I'll create the UTM structure and naming convention now. Replace `[YOUR_AFFILIATE_LINK]` with your actual affiliate URL when you have it."
- **URL already has UTM parameters**: "Your affiliate URL already has UTM parameters. I'll append additional tracking parameters without overwriting the existing ones."
- **Too many platform × content combinations (>20)**: "That's a lot of links. I'll generate the most important ones (one per platform) and provide the naming convention so you can create the rest."

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple blog + social setup

**User**: "Set up tracking for my HeyGen affiliate link (heygen.com/ref/abc123) on my blog and Twitter"
**Action**: Generate 4 links: blog-review, blog-comparison, twitter-post, twitter-thread. Each with proper UTM tags. Include Google Sheets tracking template.

### Example 2: Multi-platform campaign

**User**: "I'm launching a campaign for Semrush across LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, my blog, and email newsletter. Create all my tracking links."
**Action**: Generate 10+ links across all platforms and content types. Establish naming convention. Suggest Google Analytics goal setup for conversion tracking.

### Example 3: Chained from S1

**Context**: S1 found HeyGen with affiliate URL heygen.com/ref/abc123.
**User**: "Set up tracking for this before I start creating content."
**Action**: Pull product info from S1 output. Generate links for the user's likely content types (infer from S1 context). Prepare tracking sheet that S6.3 (performance-report) can use later.
